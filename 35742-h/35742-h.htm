<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In teaching history to boys and girls from ten to
twelve years old simple material should be used.
Children of that age like action. They crave the
dramatic, the picturesque, the concrete, the personal.
When they read about Daniel Boone or Abraham
Lincoln they do far more than admire their hero.
By a mysterious, sympathetic process they so identify
themselves with him as to feel that what they see in
him is possible for them. Herein is suggested the
ethical value of history. But such ethical stimulus,
be it noted, can come only in so far as actions are
translated into the thoughts and feelings embodied in
the actions.</p>

<p>In this process of passing from deeds to the hearts
and heads of the doers the image-forming power plays
a leading part. Therefore a special effort should be
made to train the sensuous imagination by furnishing
picturesque and dramatic incidents, and then so skilfully
presenting them that the children may get living
pictures. This I have endeavored to do in the preparation
of this historical reader, by making prominent
the personal traits of the heroes and leaders, as they
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg vi]</span>
are seen, in boyhood and manhood alike, in the environment
of their every-day home and social life.</p>

<p>With the purpose of quickening the imagination,
questions "To the Pupil" are introduced at intervals
throughout the book, and on almost every page additional
questions of the same kind might be supplied
to advantage. "What picture do you get in that
paragraph?" may well be asked over and over again,
as children read the book. If they get clear and definite
pictures, they will be likely to see the past as
a living present, and thus will experience anew the
thoughts and feelings of those who now live only in
their words and deeds. The steps in this vital process
are imagination, sympathy, and assimilation.</p>

<p>To the same end the excellent maps and illustrations
contribute a prominent and valuable feature of
the book. If, in the elementary stages of historical
reading, the image-forming power is developed, when
the later work in the study of organized history is
reached the imagination can hold the outward event
before the mind for the judgment to determine its
inner significance. For historical interpretation is
based upon the inner life quite as much as upon the
outward expression of that life in action.</p>

<p>Attention is called to the fact that while the biographical
element predominates, around the heroes
and leaders are clustered typical and significant events
in such a way as to give the basal facts of American
history. It is hoped, therefore, that this little volume
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg vii]</span>
will furnish the young mind some conception of what
our history is, and at the same time stimulate an abiding
interest in historical and biographical reading.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is needless to say that the "Review
Outline" may be used in many ways. It certainly
will furnish excellent material for language work, oral
or written. In so using it pupils may well be encouraged
to enlarge the number of topics.</p>

<p>I wish to acknowledge my obligations to Professor
William E. Mead, of Wesleyan University, who has
read the manuscript and made invaluable suggestions;
also to my wife, whose interest and assistance have
done much to give the book whatever of merit it may
possess.</p>

<p>From very early times there existed overland
routes of trade between Europe and Asia. During
the Middle Ages traffic over these routes greatly
increased, so that by the fifteenth century a large and
profitable trade was carried on between the West and
the East. Merchants in Western Europe grew rich
through trade in the silks, spices, and precious stones
that were brought by caravan and ship from India,
China, and Japan. But in 1453 the Turks conquered
Constantinople, and by frequent attacks upon Christian
vessels in the Mediterranean made the old routes
unsafe. A more practicable one became necessary.</p>

<p>Already in the early part of the fifteenth century
Portuguese sea-captains had skirted the western coast of
Africa, and by the close of the century others of their
number had rounded the Cape of Good Hope, in their
search for a water route to the Indies. But Spain, at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
that time the most powerful nation of Europe, adopted
a plan quite different from that of the Portuguese.
What this plan was and how it was carried out, we can
best understand by an acquaintance with the life and
work of the great sea-captain and navigator, Christopher
Columbus.</p>

<p>More than four hundred and fifty years ago there
lived in the city of Genoa a poor workingman, who
made his living by preparing wool for the spinners.
Of his four sons, the eldest was Christopher, born in
1436. Young Christopher was not, so far as we
know, very different from most other boys in Genoa.
He doubtless joined in their every-day sports, going
with them to see the many vessels that sailed in and
out of that famous sea-port, and listening for hours to
the stories of sailors about distant lands.</p>

<p>But he did not spend all his time in playing and
visiting the wharves, for we know that he learned his
father's trade, and in school studied, among other
things, reading, arithmetic, grammar, geography, and
map-drawing. We can easily believe that he liked
geography best of all, since it would carry his imagination
far out over the sea and to lands beyond the
sea. In map-drawing he acquired such skill that when
he became a man he could earn his living, when occasion
demanded, by making maps and charts.</p>

<p>Beyond these facts little is known about the boyhood
and youth of Columbus. Very likely much of
his early life was spent upon the sea, sailing on the
Mediterranean and along the west coast of Africa.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Once he went as far north as England and perhaps
even farther, but of this we are not certain.</p>

<p>In the course of many voyages he heard much of
the work done by Portuguese sailors and discoverers,
for Portugal was at that time one of the greatest sea-powers
of the world. As Lisbon, the capital of Portugal,
was naturally a centre for sea-faring men, and as
it was also the home of his brother Bartholomew,
Columbus, at the age of about thirty-five, went there
to live.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus018.jpg" width="800" height="573" alt="Places of Interest in Connection with Columbus's Earlier Life." title="" />
<span class="caption">Places of Interest in Connection with Columbus's Earlier Life.</span>
</div>

<p>Columbus was a man of commanding presence. He
was large, tall, and dignified in bearing, with a ruddy
complexion and piercing blue-gray eyes. By the time
he was thirty his hair had become white, and fell in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
wavy locks about his shoulders. Although his life of
hardship and poverty compelled him to be plain and
simple in food and dress, he always had the air of a
gentleman, and his manners were pleasing and courteous.
But he had a strong will, which overcame difficulties
that would have overwhelmed most men.</p>

<p>While at Lisbon, Columbus married a woman far
above him in social position, and went with her to live
on a little island of the Madeiras, where her family
had business interests. Meanwhile he was turning
over in his mind schemes for a future voyage to the
countries of the Far East. His native city, Genoa, had
grown rich in trading in the silks, spices, and precious
stones of the Indies, but the journey overland was
dangerous, and a water route was much desired.</p>

<p>This need the Portuguese had felt along with the
rest of Europe, and for a long time Portuguese sea-captains
had been slowly but surely finding their way
down the west coast of Africa, in search of a passage
around the southern cape. This route would be easier
and cheaper than the old one through the Mediterranean
and across Asia. But Columbus thought out
a more daring course, by which he planned to sail
directly west from the Canary Islands, across the Atlantic
Ocean, expecting at the end of his voyage to
find the far-famed Indies.</p>

<p>Columbus was so full of his plan that it became the
great thought of his life. A water route which would
safely bring the wealth of the East to the doors of
Europe would be the greatest discovery of the age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Moreover, his ambition was spurred by the thrilling
account of a noted traveller, Marco Polo, who two
centuries before had brought back from far-off China
wonderful tales of golden palaces, of marvellous rivers
crossed by marble bridges, and of countless treasures
of gold, silver, and jewels.</p>

<p>About 1484 Columbus laid his scheme before King
John of Portugal. The king would not promise his
assistance, but he borrowed hints from the charts of
Columbus, and sent men of his own to learn whether
they could reach land by sailing west. Meeting with
stormy weather, and fearing the unknown expanse of
ocean, the sailors soon put back to port, and brought
word that there was no land to be seen.</p>

<p>When Columbus heard what the king had done he
was very indignant, and at once quitted Portugal for
Spain. The future appeared gloomy enough to the
poor navigator without a helping friend. With bitter
memories he shook off the dust of Lisbon, and, leading
by the hand his little son Diego, four or five years
old, trudged wearily on his journey. Columbus took
Diego to the home of the boy's aunt, who lived not
far from Palos, and, leaving him in her care, went in
search of the king and queen of Spain, Ferdinand and
Isabella.</p>

<p>The king and queen were at that time so much
occupied in driving the Moors out of Spain that Columbus
found difficulty in securing a hearing. When
at last he was permitted to unfold his plans to a council
of learned men they ridiculed him, because, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>sooth,
he said that the world was round like a globe,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and people lived on the opposite side of the earth.
"Such a thing," they declared, "is absurd, for if people
live on the other side of the earth their heads must
be down. Then, too, if it rains there the rain falls upward;
and trees, if they grow there, must grow upside
down."</p>

<p>Some of the learned men, however, agreed with
Columbus, and thought the carrying out of his plan
by the aid of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella
would bring honor and countless wealth to Spain.
But their authority was not sufficient to affect those
who believed Columbus to be a crazy dreamer or a
worthless adventurer.</p>

<p>Month after month, year after year, Columbus
cherished his ambitious scheme, encouraged by the
few friends who were ready to use their influence for
him. He followed the king and queen from place to
place, as they moved their camp in the course of the
war, and he sometimes fought bravely in the Spanish
army. But in face of scorn and ridicule he never gave
up hope of success. These were days of great trial,
when even the boys in the streets tapped their foreheads
as he passed by, and pointed their fingers at him
with a peculiar smile.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1491 Columbus made up his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
mind to leave Spain and try
his fortune in France. So he
went to the home of Diego's
aunt, and once more taking
his boy with him, started on
foot out of the country which
had so little befriended him.
We can easily picture him,
pale and wayworn, his clothes
threadbare, his long white hair streaming over his
shoulders. The travellers had gone but a short distance
when they stopped at the gate of the Convent of St.
Mary, which was only a mile and a half from Palos, to
beg bread and water for the boy. At this moment the
good prior of the convent happened to pass by. He
was a man of learning and, on conversing with Columbus,
became much interested in his story, and arranged
a meeting of other learned men, among them the well-known
sea-captain, Martin Alonzo Pinzon, who lived
in Palos. The plans of Columbus appealed so strongly
to this sea-captain that he promised not only to furnish
money for an expedition, but to accompany it
himself.</p>

<p>Moreover, the prior, who had been father-confessor
to Isabella, won her over to the sailor's cause. The
queen sent what would now be nearly $1,200<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> to Columbus,
and summoned him back to Court. Supplying
himself with a mule and suitable clothing, Columbus,
with lightened heart, sought the queen's presence.
She approved his plan, but Columbus demanded so
great a reward for his services as leader of the expedition
that the queen refused to come to any agreement
with him, and let him go.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>Columbus in disgust mounted his mule, and started
once more for France. At this juncture, however, one
of the queen's advisers hurried into her presence, and
put the case so earnestly that she sent a swift courier,
who overtook Columbus in a mountain pass not far
away, and brought him back. An agreement was
soon reached, and Columbus accepted his commission
with tears of joy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus024.jpg" width="400" height="336" alt="The Pinta." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Pinta.</span>
</div>

<p>He at once went to Palos to get men and vessels
for the expedition. But here he met with serious difficulties.
Sailors called the Atlantic Ocean the Sea of
Darkness, and believed that it contained frightful sea-monsters,
ready to dash in pieces all vessels that might
come within reach. Moreover, we must remember
that the vessels in those days were not safe against
storms like the great
ships of our day. To
venture out upon this
trackless sea signified
to sailors almost certain
death. Hence,
they were unwilling
to sail, and a royal
decree had to be issued
to compel them.
Even then it became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
necessary to release criminals from prisons to supply
the number required for the expedition.</p>

<p>The three caravels that were at length got ready
for the perilous expedition westward in search of the
Indies were not larger than many of the fishing-boats
of to-day. The largest of the three&mdash;the flagship of
Columbus&mdash;was called the Santa Maria. The other
two were the Pinta and the Ni&ntilde;a ("Baby"). The
Santa Maria alone had a deck covering the entire hold
of the vessel.</p>

<p>At last all was ready, and a half-hour before sunrise
on Friday morning, August 3, 1492, this little fleet,
with one hundred and twenty men and provisions for
a year, sailed out of the port of Palos. It was a sorrowful
hour for the poor sailors, who felt that they had
looked upon their homes and their friends for the last
time. Columbus steered for the Canaries, where he
delayed three weeks to repair the rudder of the Pinta.</p>

<p>On September 6th he set sail again. When once
out of sight of land the sailors, overcome with fear,
cried and sobbed like children. But new trials awaited
them. At the end of a week the compass needle no
longer pointed to the North Star, and this strange fact
filled the superstitious sailors with alarm.</p>

<p>Great was their consternation when a few days later
the vessels entered vast stretches of sea-weed. At
first the little fleet easily ploughed its way through
this mass of floating green, but at the end of three
days, on account of a light wind, the vessels moved
more slowly. In their dismay the sailors feared that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the vessels might never get through this immense sea
of grass, but might have to lie there and rot, or, perhaps,
escaping this danger, run upon rocks and shoals
lying just beneath the grass and be broken in pieces.
Though they were in the midst of obstacles apparently
insurmountable, they were also in the path of the
trade winds that steadily bore them onward. But in
their terror, the sailors imagined they could never return
because the wind would not allow them to sail
in the opposite direction. When the wind began to
blow from the southwest they were once more relieved
of their fears.</p>

<span class="caption">The First Voyage of Columbus, and places of interest in connection with his Later

</div>

<p>After many days all hearts were gladdened by the
sight of birds, which indicated that land was near.
It was an idle hope. Again and again some eager-eyed
sailor shouted "land," but found later that he
was looking at distant clouds.</p>

<p>The crews were in despair. Now in the belt of
trade-winds that were steadily blowing them farther<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and farther from home and friends they cried in dismay:
"We can never return to Spain. We are lost!
What shall we do?" They begged Columbus to turn
back. They became angry when he refused, and declared
he was crazy and was leading them all to destruction.
They even plotted to throw him overboard
some night and say that he fell into the sea while
looking at the stars. Columbus felt that dangers
were growing thick about him, but he never faltered
in his purpose. His strong will and his abiding faith
in success kept him stanch in face of difficulties that
would have caused an ordinary mind to give way.</p>

<p>On October 11th unmistakable signs of land appeared.
A thorn branch with berries on it, a reed,
and a carved stick came floating by. New life stirred
in every heart, and the sailors looked eagerly in every
direction for land.</p>

<p>The king and queen had promised a reward equal to
nearly $600 of our present money to the sailor who
should be the first to see land. Columbus had promised
in addition a velvet cloak. Accordingly, all were
on the alert to catch the first glimpse of land, and kept
on the watch during the entire night after the appearance
of the thorn-branch and carved stick.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock Columbus himself saw in the distance
a light, which looked like a torch in the hands
of some one moving along the shore. About two
o'clock next morning, Friday, October 12th&mdash;or October
21st, according to our present method of reckoning
time&mdash;a sailor on the Pinta saw, about five miles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
off, a low strip of land. This was an island of the
Bahama Group. Just ten weeks had elapsed since
the voyage began at Palos, and with intense eagerness
Columbus and his men awaited the coming of
daylight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 593px;">
<img src="images/illus028.jpg" width="593" height="800" alt="The Triumphal Return of Columbus to Spain." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Triumphal Return of Columbus to Spain.</span>
</div>

<p>At dawn the boats were lowered, and all went on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
shore. Columbus, dressed in a rich robe of scarlet,
carried the royal standard. His followers also bore
banners, on each of which was a brilliant green cross
with the letters F. and Y.&mdash;the Spanish initials for
Ferdinand and Isabella&mdash;on each side. Above the
letters were crosses. Columbus threw himself, kneeling,
upon the ground. He wept for joy, and, kissing
the earth, took possession of the land in the name of
the king and queen of Spain. The sailors now fell
upon their knees at Columbus's feet. They kissed his
hands, and begged him to forgive them for their evil
thoughts toward him.</p>

<p>At first the natives, whom Columbus called Indians
because he thought he was in the East Indies, fled to
the woods in fear of the Spaniards; but later they returned
and worshipped the white men as beings from
the sky. They thought the vessels were great birds
and the sails wings. The Spaniards at once began to
trade with the Indians, giving them such trifles as tiny
bells, red caps, and glass beads, in exchange for tame
parrots, cotton yarn, and a few small ornaments of
gold, such as the natives wore in their noses.</p>

<p>According to the interesting description of the natives
that Columbus wrote in his journal, they were
very poor, dark-skinned, and naked. All of them
seemed to be young and of strong build, with coarse
black hair hanging long behind, but cut short over
their foreheads. Their bodies were painted with various
colors and in all manner of ways. The men
carried sticks, pointed with fish-bones, for javelins,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and moved their canoes with paddles that looked like
wooden shovels.</p>

<p>The canoes, made out of single trunks of trees,
were in some cases large enough to carry forty men.
The dwellings, which were clustered together in
groups of twelve to fifteen, were shaped like tents
and had high chimneys. Inside the tents, hanging
between posts, were nets used as beds and called
"hammocks."</p>

<p>Columbus called the island upon which he had
landed San Salvador (Holy Saviour). He wrote of
the new country: "I know not where first to go, nor
are my eyes ever weary of gazing at the beautiful verdure.
The singing of the birds is such that it seems
as if one would never desire to depart hence. There
are flocks of parrots that obscure the sun, and other
birds of many kinds, large and small, entirely different
from ours; trees, also, of a thousand species,
each having its particular fruit, and all of marvellous
flavor."</p>

<p>Columbus sailed along the coast of Cuba and
Hayti, landing here and there, and sent parties inland
to find out what they could about the land and its
people. Everywhere he was on the lookout for the
cities of Asia&mdash;those wonderful cities of wealth and
beauty described in such glowing colors by Marco
Polo. He never doubted that he was in the land he
had sought,&mdash;the East Indies.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning (December 25, 1492), while
it was still dark, as he was cruising along the shores of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Hayti (or Hispaniola), the Santa Maria went aground
on a sand-bar, where the waves soon knocked her to
pieces. As the Pinta had already deserted, there now
remained but one ship, the Ni&ntilde;a. This little vessel
was too small to accommodate all the men, and
forty of the number, wishing to stay where they were,
decided to build a fort out of the timbers of the
wrecked vessel and put her guns in the fort for
their defence. These men had provisions for a year,
and constituted the first Spanish colony in the New
World.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1493, the Ni&ntilde;a sailed for Spain.
All went well with the sailors until February 12th,
when a great storm suddenly threatened to break the
frail vessel into pieces. Poor Columbus! His heart
grew faint within him. Had he and his men endured
such peril and hardship to perish unknown in the sea?
Would the world never know of their great achievement?</p>

<p>In his anxiety he wrote on parchment two separate
accounts of his discovery, which he sealed and addressed
to Ferdinand and Isabella. He then wrapped each in
a cloth and, enclosing them in large cakes of wax, put
them into barrels. One of these barrels he flung into
the sea, and the other he kept on deck. The Ni&ntilde;a
passed safely through the storm, however, and on
March 15th, after an absence of nearly seven and a
half months, cast anchor in the harbor of Palos.</p>

<p>The successful voyager lost no time in reaching
Barcelona, where he was received by the king and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
queen with triumphal honors. Everybody was ready
to praise the man who had become so famous. There
was a great procession in his honor in the streets of
Barcelona. Leading this street parade were six Indians
whom Columbus had brought back with him.
These were smeared with paint, decked with feathers
of tropical birds, and ornamented with bits of gold.
Following them came men carrying stuffed and live
birds of brilliant plumage, and the skins of different
animals, all products of the New Land. Columbus
rode on horseback, attended by many of Spain's great
men, mounted on horses.</p>

<p>When the procession reached the house in which
King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were, Columbus
went into the room where they sat on the throne.
They did him the honor to rise as he entered, and
when he knelt to kiss their hands, they again honored
him, by bidding him rise and sit, like an equal, in
their presence.</p>

<p>The poor sailor, once despised as an idle dreamer,
had become a distinguished personage, honored alike
by kings and princes and people. It was no longer
necessary to force men by royal decree to sail with the
great admiral. Many were now eager to go where
they might reap wealth and honor.</p>

<p>In September, 1493, Columbus again sailed, this
time with a fleet of seventeen vessels and fifteen hundred
men. Many of the latter were young men of
noble birth, and belonged to families of wide influence.
All supposed they were going to the East Indies, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
land of jewels and spices and precious metals. With
the purpose of founding a colony, Columbus took
with him not only horses, mules, and cattle, but vines,
vegetables, and seeds of many kinds.</p>

<p>When the fleet reached the island of Hayti, and the
place where he had in the previous winter left the little
colony of forty men, he found that the fort and provisions
had been destroyed, and that eleven corpses
had been buried near by; but not one of the forty
men was ever again seen alive. After building a little
town, called Isabella in honor of the queen, Columbus
began exploring by land and sea. He found much that
was beautiful and interesting, but much more that was
disappointing. Moreover, the Indians were sometimes
unfriendly, and his own men were often unruly and
treacherous. At length, after four years of varying
fortune, he started home, and after a long, hard voyage,
during which provisions gave out, he and his men,
weak with hunger, finally reached Spain in June. He
was kindly received, and was promised more ships for
another voyage.</p>

<p>In May, 1498, with six vessels and two hundred men
besides the sailors, Columbus started on a third voyage,
this time directing his course more to the south than
he had done before. He landed on an island which
he named Trinidad, and then sailed along the northern
coast of South America.</p>

<p>He was not well, however, and in August turned
his course for Santo Domingo, where he found things
were going badly. Trouble with the Indians had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
arisen, and even more serious trouble in the colony
itself had broken out. For two years Columbus struggled
to set things right. But he was not successful as
a colonizer. Besides, many people were beginning to
lose faith in him because he did not get expected
treasures for Spain. Many others were jealous of his
fame, and plotted to ruin him. At length an official
was sent from Spain to Hayti to look into the situation.
When he reached the island he confiscated Columbus's
property, put him in chains, and sent him as
a prisoner to the country from which he had but recently
sailed with high honor.</p>

<p>In Spain the people were in sympathy with the admiral
in his disgrace; so too was the queen, who sent
money and summoned him to court. She received
him there with tears in her eyes, and he broke down
and wept at her feet.</p>

<p>In 1502 Columbus started on a fourth voyage,
sailing along the eastern coast of Central America.
But he was not able to accomplish much, and finally
suffered shipwreck on the island of Jamaica, where he
spent a year of misery. At last he set out for home,
arriving there only a short time before Queen Isabella,
his only protector, died.</p>

<p>Poor, sick, and discouraged, Columbus dragged out
a weary life for eighteen months longer. He died in
Spain of a broken heart, May 20, 1506, in utter ignorance
of the greatness of his discovery. So little appreciated
was he that the city annals make no mention of
his death. It remained for succeeding generations to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
lift his name from obscurity and to give faithful acknowledgment
of his achievements in the advance of
human progress.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the New World by Columbus,
the Spaniards, who had no other thought
than that he had found a new way to India, dreamed
eagerly of its marvellous wealth, and were impatient
to be off to the land where they believed fortunes
awaited them. So zealous were they, in their mad
search for gold and adventure, that many were willing
to leave home and friends for years.</p>

<p>The most brilliant of these explorers were Cortez,
the conqueror of Mexico, and Pizarro, the conqueror
of Peru, both of whom carried back to Spain many
million dollars' worth of gold and silver. With Pizarro
was a young man named Hernando De Soto,
whose adventurous life is full of interest, and whose
important discovery of the Mississippi River has given
him a prominent place in the history of our country.</p>

<p>He was born about 1500, of a poor but noble fam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>ily.
In his youth he excelled in athletic sports, and
possessed unusual skill in horsemanship and in fencing.
Taking a leading part in all the dangerous exploits
in the New World, he not only won fame, but
went back to Spain after many years' absence a rich
man.</p>

<p>While Cortez and Pizarro had been conquering
Mexico and Peru, other Spaniards had been seeking
their fortune in Florida.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Thus far these men had
brought back no gold and silver, but their faith in the
mines of the interior was so great that De Soto wished
to conquer and explore the country. Having already
won great influence by his achievements, he secured
the favor of the king, who made him governor of the
island of Cuba, and appointed him leader of an expedition
to conquer and occupy Florida. He was to
take men enough with him to build forts and plant a
colony, so as to hold the country for Spain.</p>

<p>De Soto had no difficulty in getting followers to join
him in this enterprise. Young men from noble families
flocked to his standard from all parts of Spain, and
as he knew that dangers and hardships awaited them
he was careful to select from the large numbers the
strongest men.</p>

<p>De Soto's company included richly dressed nobles
and warriors in glittering armor. It was a gala day
when they sailed out of port with banners flying and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>cannon booming, and not a young man of them but
felt proud to sail on so grand an expedition. After
arriving in Cuba, De Soto spent some time there, and
then leaving his wife to govern the island, set out to
explore Florida. His expedition was an imposing one,
comprising nine vessels, six hundred men, and about
two hundred and twenty-five horses. In May, 1539,
the whole force landed at Tampa Bay, on the western
coast of Florida.</p>

<p>They had not advanced far into the interior when
De Soto fell in with a Spaniard named Ortiz, who had
accompanied Narvaez in a previous expedition some
ten or eleven years before. According to his story,
the Indians had captured him, and only forbore to kill
him because an Indian girl had begged for his life.
Ortiz had lived with the Indians so many years that
he had become very much like one himself; but we
can imagine his joy at seeing white men once more.
The Spaniards were equally rejoiced because they
knew how serviceable their countryman would be as a
guide and interpreter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">DE SOTO DISCOVERING THE MISSISSIPPI</span>
</div>

<p>The advantage of this good-fortune was soon counteracted,
however, by De Soto's unfriendliness to the
Indians. He was not only indifferent to their pleasure
and sufferings, but even seemed to enjoy torturing and
killing them. It was his custom upon arriving at an
Indian settlement to demand food for his men and
horses, and upon his departure to carry off with him
the head chief as guide and hostage, not releasing him
until the next tribe was reached. Indian men and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
squaws were forced into service as porters for the
Spanish baggage; and thus enslaved, often with chains
and with iron collars about their necks, they were compelled
to do all sorts of menial work. It is not strange
that after such treatment the Indians lost all confidence
in De Soto. They not only learned to hate him and
the Spaniards but longed to be revenged upon them.
In return for the cruelties inflicted they purposely led
the Spaniards astray, and left untried no treachery
which would serve to destroy the pale-faced strangers.</p>

<p>In May, 1540, an Indian princess, rowed by her
followers in a canopied canoe, came across a stream to
meet De Soto. When she landed, her followers carried
her in a litter, from which she alighted and approached
him. She gave him presents of shawls and
skins, and a string of pearls which she took from
around her neck. In return for these acts of courtesy
De Soto made her a prisoner, and kept her going about
on foot with him until she escaped.</p>

<p>This is but an instance of the cruelty which made
enemies of all the Indians with whom the Spaniards
came in contact. No doubt Indian runners were sent
hundreds of miles in many directions to tell the various
tribes of the inhuman deeds of the white men.
No doubt these tribes combined in a desperate effort
to destroy De Soto and all his men. How nearly they
succeeded in their plan can be told in a few lines.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1540 the Spaniards came to the
tribe of a giant chieftain whose slaves held over him,
as he sat upon cushions on a raised platform, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
buckskin umbrella stained red and white. He was
sullen in the presence of the richly dressed Spaniards
on their prancing steeds, but allowed De Soto to
carry him a prisoner to the next Indian town, as the
other head chiefs had
done.</p>

<span class="caption">Routes Traversed by De Soto and De Leon.</span>
</div>

<p>This town was called
Mavilla, an Indian
word from which we
get the name Mobile
for the city and river
in Alabama. As the
Spaniards approached
this town Indians came
out to meet them, their
faces showing signs of displeasure and evil intent.
Fearing nothing, however, De Soto, attended by about
a dozen of his men, rode boldly inside the town, which
was surrounded with a palisade.</p>

<p>The giant chieftain then asked for a release that he
might return to his own people, and on being refused
went into a house in which many Indian warriors were
concealed. When De Soto ordered him to come out
he refused. In the excitement that followed, a Spaniard
cut down with his sword an Indian warrior standing
near by. Then, in wild fury, hundreds of dusky
warriors rushed like madmen out of the house to
the attack, and soon shot down five of De Soto's
body-guard. Of course he had to flee for his life.
But before he could reach the main force outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
the town he fell to the ground two or three times,
struck by Indian arrows.</p>

<p>It was the beginning of a terrible battle, in which
the Spaniards, although outnumbered, had the advantage
because of their horses, swords, firearms, and superior
training. Finally, from the outside, they closed
the gates to the town, and set fire to the Indian buildings.
The Indians fought with desperation, but they
either fell, cut down by Spanish swords, or rushed in
mad fury to perish in the flames. When night came,
only three Indian warriors remained alive. Two of these
fought until they were killed, and the last unfortunate
one hanged himself on a tree with his bow-string.
The Spaniards said they killed at least 2,500 Indians,
but they lost in killed and wounded about a third of
their own number. It was a dearly bought victory.</p>

<p>Nor was Indian craftiness the only source of
trouble for the Spaniards. De Soto's men had to
travel through thick forests with no road except the
narrow path made by wild animals or the trail made
by the Indian hunter. They spent many laborious
days in picking their way through dense underbrush
and miry swamps, stopping here and there to make
rafts to carry them across the numerous streams.
Often without food and on the point of starving, they
were obliged to feed upon native dogs, and were sometimes
reduced to berries, nuts, bear-oil, and wild honey.</p>

<p>In spite of hunger, disease, death, and many other
misfortunes, however, De Soto in his mad search for
gold threaded his way through the tangled forests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
until, in the spring of 1541, about two years after
landing at Tampa Bay, he reached the bank of the
Mississippi River. After spending months in making
boats, he at length crossed the mighty stream, and
then continued his march in a northerly and westerly
direction, going, it would seem, as far as the site of
what is now Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas.</p>

<p>Marching southeast, probably to the banks of the
Washita, he spent a winter so severe that many of the
party, including Ortiz, died.</p>

<p>About the middle of April, 1542, the Spaniards,
travel-spent and sick at heart, reached the mouth of
the Red River, where De Soto, discouraged and broken
in spirit, was taken ill with fever and soon died.
At first his followers buried his body near the town
where they were staying, but when the Indians began
with some suspicion to examine the ground under
which he lay, the Spaniards in the darkness of night
took up the body, wrapped it in blankets made
heavy with sand, and sadly lowered it into the
waters of the mighty river which it was De Soto's
chief honor to have discovered. After many more
hardships the wretched survivors of this unhappy company,
numbering not many more than half of those
who landed at Tampa Bay, found their way to a Spanish
colony in Mexico. Thus ended in disaster the
expedition which sailed with such hope of wealth and
renown.</p>

<p>Only five years after Columbus made his discoveries
in the West India Islands, John Cabot
sailed from England in search of a short northwest
passage to Asia. Directing his course across the northern
part of the Atlantic Ocean, he landed somewhere
on the eastern coast of North America, perhaps on the
shores of Labrador. His son sailed in the following
year along the coast from Nova Scotia down as far as
North Carolina. By reason of these discoveries and
explorations, England laid claim to North America.</p>

<p>Nearly a hundred years passed before England took
any further steps toward getting a foothold in America.
In the meantime Spain, by means of her naval power,
had conquered Mexico and Peru, and planted colonies
at various points in the New World.</p>

<p>The precious metals collected by Spanish explorers
in Mexico and Peru had furnished the money with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
which Spain was enabled to carry on her expeditions
as well as the almost continuous wars with other
European powers. Some people think that Spain took
out of these two countries gold and silver to an
amount that would now equal five thousand million
dollars.</p>

<p>At this time England had not so strong a navy as
she has to-day, and the Spanish King hoped because
of her weakness to conquer England and make her a
dependency of Spain. Of course this roused the English
people, and they determined to thwart the ambitious
scheming of the Spanish King.</p>

<p>Although England had not a fighting navy, English
seamen were alert to capture Spanish vessels and
rob them of their gold and silver. To seize these
prizes, such bold sea-captains as Drake and Hawkins
roamed the sea, burning and plundering Spanish fleets
and Spanish settlements along the coast of Mexico
and South America.</p>

<p>Conspicuous among these daring sea-rovers and
explorers was Sir Walter Raleigh, one of the most
distinguished Englishman of his time. He was born
in a town near the sea-coast in Devonshire, England,
in 1552, his father and mother both being of high
social rank.</p>

<p>In this town lived many old sailors, who could tell
the wide-awake boy stirring tales of seafaring life and
of bloody fights with Spaniards. Walter was a patriotic
boy, and therefore soon learned to hate Spain,
because of her insolence toward the English people.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
As he became older and learned more of the power of
Spain, especially that which came through possessions
in the New World, he was envious for his country's
sake and wished her to become Spain's rival in wealth.</p>

<span class="caption">Cabot's Route. Land discovered by him darkened.</span>
</div>

<p>When Walter was
old enough, he was
sent to Oxford University,
where he became
an earnest student.
But at seventeen
he put aside his
studies and went to
France to join the
Huguenot army.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> After
remaining there for
about six years, he returned
to England and
served for a short time in the English army, fighting
against Spain and Austria in the Netherlands.
Later he went as captain of a hundred men to Ireland,
and there proved himself a brave soldier.</p>

<p>Returning again to England, by a simple act of
courtesy he won the admiration of the powerful queen
Elizabeth. It happened in this way. On one occasion,
when with her attendants she was about to cross
a muddy road, Raleigh stood looking on. Noticing
that the queen hesitated for an instant, he took from
his shoulder his beautiful velvet cloak and gallantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>spread it in her pathway. The queen, greatly pleased
with this delicate attention, took Raleigh into her
Court and in time bestowed upon him much honor.
She not only made him a knight, but presented him
with costly gifts and estates, and showered upon him
offices of rank and dignity. The brave knight, Sir
Walter Raleigh, became a man of great wealth and
influence.</p>

<p>As a courtier his dress was rich and dazzling.
He wore a hat with a pearl band and a black jewelled
feather. His shoes, which were tied with white ribbons,
were studded with gems worth six thousand six
hundred gold pieces. He had also a suit of silver
armor that glittered with diamonds and other precious
stones.</p>

<p>This splendor did not seem so much out of place
in those days as it would now, for much display and
ceremony were customary in court life. Queen Elizabeth,
with her ten hundred and seventy-five dresses
and mantles, ornamented with lace, embroidery, and
jewels, and with her eighty wigs of various colors, set
a gorgeous example which her courtiers were delighted
to follow.</p>

<p>But Raleigh was not satisfied with the glamour of
court life. He was eager to achieve glory for England
and if possible to elevate her upon the ruins of her
enemy, Spain.</p>

<span class="caption">Queen Elizabeth.</span>
</div>

<p>It was his desire to build up a new England for the
glory of the old, and to that end he secured from
Queen Elizabeth a charter for planting a colony in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
America. He therefore fitted out two vessels which
were to sail to the land north of Florida, then occupied
by Spain, and bring back reports of the country.</p>

<p>The captains of these vessels arrived in Pamlico
Sound, and landed on an island
which they found rich in
grapes and woods and abounding
in deer and other game.
The explorers received kind
treatment from the Indians,
two of whom accompanied the
voyagers to England on their
return. Queen Elizabeth was
so pleased with the good reports
from the new country that she
called it Virginia in honor of
herself&mdash;the Virgin Queen.</p>

<p>The next year, 1585, Raleigh sent out to Virginia
seven vessels and one hundred colonists, under his
cousin, Sir Richard Grenville, and Ralph Lane. They
landed on Roanoke Island, and made a settlement
there, but the colony was not prosperous. At the
outset, by unwise and cruel treatment they made
enemies of the natives. It is related that, an Indian
having stolen a silver cup from one of the colonists,
the Englishmen burned an entire village and ruined
the corn belonging to its people. Such punishment
was out of all proportion to the petty offence. It is
not surprising, therefore, that from that time the
settlers found the Indians unfriendly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>Very soon Grenville sailed back to England, leaving
the colony in charge of Ralph Lane. The colonists
instead of building houses and tilling the soil to supply
food, were bent upon finding gold. Hence they listened
with eager interest to a story that the Indians
told of the Roanoke River. According to this story,
the river flowed out of a fountain in a rock so near
the ocean that in time of storm the waves dashed over
into the fountain. The river, the Indians said, flowed
near rich mines of gold and silver, in a country where
there was a town with walls made of pearls. Lane
and his followers foolishly started up the river in a
vain search for this wonderful land. They encountered
many difficulties, including hostile attacks by
Indians, and suffered so much from lack of food that
they had to eat the flesh of their own dogs.</p>

<p>But despite these hardships, they made their way
back to Roanoke Island, reaching it just in time to
save the colony from destruction by the Indians. A
little later Sir Francis Drake, with a fleet of twenty-three
vessels, appeared off the coast. He had come
on his way home from the West Indies, where he had
been plundering the Spanish settlements, and cheerfully
consented to take the destitute and homesick
colonists back to England. A few days after their
departure Grenville arrived with fresh supplies, and
found the settlement deserted. Leaving a garrison of
fifteen men, with provisions for two years, to hold
possession, he then sailed back to England.</p>

<p>Although the settlement did not succeed, this effort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
to plant a colony was not wholly fruitless, for the
colonists took to England on their return three products
which gave to the people a somewhat different
idea of the real wealth of the new lands. These
were not precious metals,
but products of the
soil, namely, tobacco,
the white potato, and
Indian corn.</p>

<span class="caption">Section where Raleigh's various colonies were located.</span>
</div>

<p>The discovery of the
tobacco plant introduced
into England the
custom of smoking,
and a curious story is
told of it in connection
with Sir Walter Raleigh,
who soon learned to smoke. One day his servant,
who knew nothing of the new custom, came into his
master's room and found him smoking from a silver
pipe. Believing Raleigh was on fire, the faithful servant
hastily dashed a mug of ale at him to quench
the flames and rescue him from death.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 283px;">

<span class="caption">Entrance to Raleigh's Cell in the Tower.</span>
</div>

<p>The wealth that lay hidden in the soil was yet unknown,
and no one felt any enthusiasm over the new
colony of Virginia. Most men would by this time
have lost hope. But Raleigh was not daunted. Two
years later he made a second attempt to plant a colony
in the New World, this time sending over three ships,
with a hundred and fifty settlers, including seventeen
women. John White was appointed governor of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
colony. These settlers had the fore-thought
to carry with them farming
implements to use in tilling the soil.
When they landed on Roanoke Island
they found no trace of the fifteen
men left there two years before
by Sir Richard Grenville. The new
settlers had not been on the island
long before they were in need of
help from England, and begged
Governor White to return home for
provisions and more settlers. White at first refused
to leave them, but finally consented. A warm interest
in the feeble settlement and love for his little granddaughter,
born soon after the settlers arrived, persuaded
him to yield. This little girl, the first white
girl born in America, was named after the new country,
Virginia, her full name being Virginia Dare.</p>

<p>When Governor White left the settlement he expected
to return immediately, but upon reaching England
he found his countrymen greatly excited over
the coming invasion of the much-dreaded "Spanish
Armada." Everybody was astir, and Raleigh was
aroused to his fullest energy in preparation to meet
the hated foe.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this, he found time to fit out
two small vessels for Governor White. Although they
sailed, trouble with the Spaniards compelled their return
to England, and not until two years later, when
the Spanish Armada had been defeated, did Governor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
White sail again for Virginia, this time as a passenger
in a West Indiaman. He landed on Roanoke Island
as before, but there remained of the settlement only
some chests of books, some maps, and some firearms,
all of which had been ruined by the Indians.</p>

<p>Upon bidding Governor White farewell, the colonists
had agreed to carve on a tree the name of the
place to which they would go if they should decide to
leave Roanoke Island. They were also to carve above
the name a cross if they were in serious trouble. Governor
White found the word CROATOAN cut in
capital letters on a large tree, but he found no cross.
Before White could sail to Croatoan, which was an
island not far away, he had to return to England
because the captain of the vessel, having encountered
stormy weather, refused to sail further. What became
of the lost colonists is still a mystery. It is possible
that the Indians either killed them or captured and
enslaved them.</p>

<p>Raleigh sent out other expeditions in search of the
lost colony, but without success.  He had already
spent a sum equal to more than a million dollars in
trying to plant this colony,
and now felt that
he must give up all
hope of accomplishing
his purpose.</p>

<span class="caption">Tower of London.</span>
</div>



<p>But this was only
one of his many disappointments.
Because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
he was a favorite of the queen and had been a successful
man he had many enemies who were jealous
of his good fortune. Men of power envied him and
tried to weaken his influence and do him injury. As
his failures increased, his popularity diminished and he
at length became bitter in spirit.</p>

<p>On the death of Queen Elizabeth, James I. became
king and, not favoring Raleigh, at length threw him
into prison on a charge of treason. After an imprisonment
of twelve years in the Tower of London, Sir
Walter was beheaded. Just as he was about to lay
his head upon the block, he felt the keen edge of the
axe, saying, "This is a sharp medicine, but a sound
cure for all diseases." Although he failed to carry
out the great desire of his heart, Raleigh gave the
English people some definite ideas in regard to the
value of the New World as a place for colonizing&mdash;ideas
which before many years found expression in the
settlement of Jamestown.</p>

<p>About twenty years after the failure of Raleigh's
attempt to plant a settlement in America, another
effort was made by a body of merchants and
wealthy men called the London Company. Their purpose
was to discover gold, of which Englishmen were
then dreaming, just as the Spaniards had dreamed years
before when they sailed under the leadership of Columbus,
Pizarro, Cortez, and De Soto. As a beginning
for the new colony, which was destined to be the
first permanent English settlement in America, the
London Company sent out one hundred and five
men, who set sail from London on New Year's day,
1607, in three frail vessels. They were not sturdy,
self-reliant men such as give strength to a new enterprise.
On the contrary, about half of them were
"gentlemen," who felt themselves above working
with their hands. They were coming to America to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
pick up a fortune, and then return to England to
live at ease the rest of their lives. As we shall see,
such colonists were unfit for the rough and rugged
life which awaited them in the wild woods of a new
country.</p>

<p>Instead of sailing straight across the Atlantic they
took a very much longer route, directing their course
down the coast of France and Spain to the Canaries
and from these islands to the West Indies. Here
they stopped a long time. The result was that they
were about four months on the tiresome voyage, and
had used up nearly all their provisions before reaching
their journey's end.</p>

<p>This was but a beginning of their troubles. Their
purpose had been to land on the deserted site of Raleigh's
colony, Roanoke Island, but, a violent storm
having driven them out of their course, they entered
Chesapeake Bay, naming the headlands on either side
Cape Charles and Cape Henry, after the king's sons.
Pushing on, they found a quiet harbor which they fittingly
called Point Comfort. After resting here they
sailed up the river and named it the James, after
James I., King of England.</p>

<p>They were delighted with the country, for it was
the month of May and the banks of the river were
luxuriant with beautiful trees, shrubbery, and many-colored
flowers. Fifty miles from the mouth of the
James the voyagers landed on a peninsula, which they
chose as the place of settlement because it was within
easy reach of the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>At once they set to work building dwellings, and a
fort in which to defend themselves against unfriendly
Indians. The dwellings at first consisted of rude
cabins roofed with sage or bark, tents made of old
sails, and holes dug in the ground. An old sail served
for the roof of their first church, and a plank nailed
up between two trees for a pulpit.</p>

<p>They did well to found their Church so early, for
they soon had need of its consolations. The intense
heat of July and August and the sultry atmosphere
hanging over the swamps and marshes bred disease,
and caused many of the colonists to fall ill of fever.
Sometimes three or four died in a single night. To
make matters worse, food was so scarce that each
settler's daily portion was reduced to a half-pint of
mouldy wheat and the same quantity of barley. And,
as if these afflictions from climate, scanty food, bad
water, and loss of friends were not enough, the Indians
kept the wretched settlers in constant terror of
their lives. Each man had to take his turn "every
third night" lying on the damp, bare ground to watch
against attack, although at times there were not five
men strong enough to carry guns. Their condition
was indeed pitiable. Those in health were not sufficient
to nurse the sick, and during the summer about
half of the settlers died.</p>

<span class="caption">John Smith and the Indians.</span>
<p>When Smith fully grasped the situation he threatened the Indians with death, and then
finding himself surrounded by hundreds of hostile warriors, he boldly seized Powhatan's
brother by the scalp-lock, put a pistol to his breast, and cried, "Corn, or your life!"</p>
</div>


<p>All must have perished but for the bravery and
strength of one man, John Smith, who for several
years kept the struggling colony alive by his personal
authority and wise treatment of the Indians. Born in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>England in 1579, he was at the time of the settlement
of Jamestown twenty-eight years old. While but a
boy he was left an orphan, and was early apprenticed
to a trade; but he had such a longing for adventure
that he soon ran away and went to the Continent to
seek his fortune.</p>

</div>

<p>From that time his life, according to his own story,
was full of stirring incidents, only a few of which we
can tell here. While travelling through France he
was robbed and left helpless in a forest on the highway,
where he would have died from exposure and
lack of food but for the kindly aid of a peasant who
chanced to find and rescue him. Going to Marseilles
he took passage on a ship with some pilgrims bound
eastward on a journey to the Holy Land. During the
voyage a severe storm arose, which greatly alarmed the
pilgrims, and, believing that in some mysterious way
their strange passenger was the cause of their misfortune,
they threw him overboard. Smith managed to
save himself from the sea, however, and a little later
fought in a war against the Turks, three of whose
mighty warriors he slew in single combat. Afterward
he was captured and enslaved by the Turks, but he
seemed to lead a charmed life, and with his usual good-fortune
again made his escape.</p>

<span class="caption">Ruins of Jamestown.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1604 he returned to England, at the age of
twenty-five, in time to join the expedition to Virginia.
With such a training as Smith had received in his
many strange adventures, he was well equipped for the
various difficulties that had to be met in the unsettled
life of the new colony in the forests of Virginia.</p>

<p>When the cool weather
of the autumn set in, the
general health of all improved
and food became
abundant, for the streams
were alive with swans,
geese, ducks, and various
kinds of fish, while game
and garden supplies were
plentiful.</p>

<span class="caption">Jamestown and the Surrounding Country.</span>
</div>

<p>As soon as affairs were
in a promising condition,
Smith started one very cold
December day on a journey
of exploration. He sailed up the Chickahominy
River in search of the South Sea, as the Pacific Ocean
was then called. This was generally believed to be
just beyond the mountains. When the stream had
become too shallow for the barge, Smith with his four
companions, two men and two Indian guides, continued
his journey in a canoe. Landing near what is
now called White Oak Swamp, he left the white men
in charge of the canoe, and with one Indian pushed
his way into the forest. Soon they were set upon by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
a band of two hundred Indian warriors, but Smith so
bravely defended himself that he killed two of the warriors,
and held out against the entire force until he sank
in the mire and had to surrender. Having tied their
prisoner to a tree, the
Indians were about to
shoot him with an arrow
when he aroused
their curiosity by
showing them his
pocket-compass and by
asking that he might
write a letter to his
friends at Jamestown.
Granting the request,
they delivered the letter
and brought back
the articles for which
it called. They were
greatly amazed that
the white man was
able to make paper
talk, and, believing
him to be a superior being,
they spared his life.</p>

<p>Smith became much interested in the life of the
Indians, and left an account of their customs and
habits. According to his description, some of them
lived in rude dwellings made of boughs of trees, some
in huts, and others in wigwams a hundred feet or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
so in length, which served for a number of families.
The warriors painted their bodies in many colors, and
decorated themselves with beads, feathers, shells, pieces
of copper, and rattles. What clothing they wore was
made of skins, and their weapons were bows and
arrows and clubs.</p>

<span class="caption">Sioux Indian Bow

</div>

<p>The Indians had many kinds of horrible dances,
in the course of which they yelled and shrieked as if
suffering the most painful torture. The squaws carried
the burdens, built the wigwams, and performed
the various necessary duties; and the men did the
hunting, the fishing, the smoking, and especially the
fighting.</p>

<p>The Indians took Smith to many of their villages,
leading him finally into the presence of Powhatan, who
lived in one of the long wigwams mentioned above, on
the north bank of the York River, about fifteen miles
from Jamestown.</p>

<p>The old chief was tall and stalwart, with a round
fat face and thin gray hair hanging down his back.
Dressed in a robe of raccoon skins, he sat before the
fire on a sort of bench covered with mats, with a
young maiden sitting on each side; at his right and
left stood the warriors, and close to the wall on either
side a row of squaws.</p>

<p>Presently one of the squaws brought to Smith some
water in a wooden bowl, and another a bunch of feathers
upon which to wipe his hands. Then followed a
step in the proceedings that must have caused even
a stout heart to quake. Having placed two stones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
upon the ground, the grim warriors seized
Smith, laid his head upon the stones, and stood
ready to slay him with clubs. But just at that
moment the chief's little daughter, Pocahontas,
about ten years old, fell upon Smith's body,
threw her arms around his neck, and begged
her father to spare his life. Powhatan's heart
was so touched that he released Smith and
allowed him to return three days later to
Jamestown.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1609 Smith started
out on another expedition in search of
the Pacific. He sailed as before by way
of Chesapeake Bay, exploring far
up the Potomac. It is needless to say
that he did not reach the Pacific, but he
covered a distance of about three thousand
miles, and made a map of his explorations,
which is considered remarkable for its accuracy.</p>

<p>In the autumn Captain Newport came
from England with orders from the London
Company to crown Powhatan. Along
with the crown the company sent gifts,
consisting of a bed, a basin, a pitcher,
and a scarlet robe. Powhatan gave token
of his appreciation of the gifts by sending
in return to King James a pair of
his moccasins and one of his raccoon-skin
blankets, but refused to kneel in receiving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the crown, so that Smith and Newport had to
lean on his shoulders to force him down.</p>

<span class="caption">A Pappoose Case.</span>
</div>

<p>The crowning of Powhatan was intended to
win his favor, but the compliment did not make
the shrewd old chief altogether friendly to the
white strangers. For he noticed that their numbers
were increasing, and he feared that their
coming might in the end bring
harm to himself and his people.
He therefore planned to get rid of
the Englishmen by refusing them corn,
and in the following winter declined to
supply them, asking in a hostile way
when they were going home.</p>

<p>The settlers sadly missed his friendly
aid, for the rats that had come over in
the vessels had played havoc with their
provisions, and they were greatly in need
of corn, venison, and game, such as
Powhatan had furnished the previous
year.</p>

<p>But Smith, who knew so well how to manage the
Indians, was equal to the occasion. He used smooth
words if they served his purpose; if not, he used
threats or even force. Bent upon gaining their good-will,
or at least determined to secure corn, Smith
sailed down the James, around Point Comfort, and up
the York River with about forty men to Powhatan's
home. The old chief pretended to be friendly, but
Smith learned from an Indian informer that the wily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
savage was planning to murder him and his men.
Little Pocahontas, also, came to Smith in the darkness
of night and told him of the plot, thus proving herself,
as on many other occasions, to be a true friend to the
white men. Indeed, it has been said that by her
timely aid the Jamestown settlement was saved from
ruin.</p>

<p>When Smith fully grasped the situation he threatened
the Indians with death, and then, finding himself
surrounded by hundreds of hostile warriors, he boldly
seized Powhatan's brother by the scalp-lock, put a
pistol to his breast, and cried, "Corn or your life!"
The Indians, awed by Smith's fearlessness, no longer
held out, but brought him corn in abundance.</p>

<p>From the first Smith had been the natural leader of
the colony, and in time was made president of the
council. He found the men of his own race almost
as difficult to manage as the Indians. They were so
lazy that Smith was obliged to make a law by which
he declared, "He that will not work shall not eat."
The law proved to be a good one, and the idlers were
soon busy making glass, felling trees, and preparing
tar, pitch, and soap-ashes. But they hated rough
labor, and were very apt to swear when it hurt their
hands. To put an end to the swearing, Smith required
each man to keep a record of his oaths, and for every
offence ordered a can of cold water poured down the
sleeve of the uplifted right arm of the culprit. By
such discipline the settlement was soon put into excellent
working order.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>If Smith could have remained at the head of the
colony, everything might have continued to go well.
But one day, while out in a boat, he was wounded so
severely by the explosion of some gunpowder that he
was obliged to return to England for treatment. This
accident happened in October, 1609. Five years later
he returned to Virginia and explored the coast to the
north, making a map of the region, and naming it
New England. He not only wrote an account of his
own life, but also several books on America. He died
in 1632, at the age of fifty-three years. Without his
leadership, the weak and puny colony at Jamestown
must have perished before the end of its first year.
But his resolution and courage held it together until it
received from England the help needed to put it on a
firm footing.</p>

<p>When Smith returned to England he left the
colony without a leader. At once the Indians,
who had been held in check by fear of Smith,
began to rob and plunder the settlement, and at the
same time famine and disease aided in the work of destruction.
Dogs, horses, and even rats and mice were
in demand for food, and while at its worst the famine
compelled the suffering colonists to feed upon the
bodies of their own dead.</p>

<span class="caption">Tobacco Plant.</span>
</div>

<p>At the close of that terrible winter, known ever
since as the "Starving Time," barely sixty of the five
hundred men whom Smith had left in the colony survived.
The future promised nothing, and the wretched
remnant of sufferers were about to leave Virginia for
their fatherland when an English vessel hove in sight
on the James. Greatly to their relief and joy Lord
Delaware had arrived with a company of men and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
much-needed supplies. This was in
June, 1610.</p>

<p>By reason of ill-health Lord Delaware
soon returned to England,
leaving Sir Thomas Dale in control
of the colony. He was even more
firm and vigorous than Smith had
been in dealing with the worthless
men who made the greater part of
the colony. Some of the most unruly
were flogged, some were branded
with hot irons, and one man was sentenced to death
by starvation.</p>

<p>Holding down the lawless by the arm of the law,
Dale was also able to introduce reform. Before he took
charge of affairs in Virginia there was a common storehouse
from which everybody, whether idle or industrious,
could get food. When the good-for-nothing
settlers found out that they could thus live upon the
products of others' labor, they would do nothing themselves,
but held back, throwing all the work upon
thirty or forty men. Dale, appreciating the evil of
this system, gave to every man his own plot of land.
Out of what he raised each was obliged to put into
the common storehouse two and a half barrels of corn;
the rest of his crop he could call his own. By this
plan the idlers had to work or starve, and the thrifty
were encouraged to work harder, because they knew
they would receive the benefit of their labor.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after the new system was put in practice the
settlers discovered that great profits resulted from
raising tobacco. The soil and climate of Virginia
were especially favorable to its growth, and more
money could be made in this way than in any other.
But since tobacco quickly exhausted the soil, much
new land was needed to take the place of the old, and
large plantations were necessary. Every planter tried
to select a plantation on one of the numerous rivers
of Virginia, so that he could easily take his tobacco
down to the wharf, whence a vessel would carry it to
Europe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 667px;">
<img src="images/illus072.jpg" width="667" height="600" alt="Loading Tobacco." title="" />
<span class="caption">Loading Tobacco.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>For a long time the planters were very prosperous
through their tobacco culture, some even becoming
wealthy. But a turn of fortune made things bad for
them. The Navigation Laws were passed, which required
them to send all their tobacco to England in
English vessels. These laws also required that the
planters should buy from England all the European
goods that might be needed, and should bring them
over to Virginia in English vessels.</p>

<p>The effect was to compel the colonist to sell his
tobacco at whatever price English merchants were
willing to pay, and to buy his goods at whatever price
the English merchant saw fit to charge. Moreover,
England laid heavy taxes on colonial trade, and when,
after a while, the price of tobacco fell, the planter received
small return for his labor.</p>

<p>But these grievous trade regulations were not all
that vexed the colonist. He had troubles at home
even more irritating than the impositions of England.
In 1660 Sir William Berkeley, a narrow-minded, selfish
man, became Governor of Virginia. This polished
cavalier, fond of the pleasures of the table and of good
company, cared far more for his seventy horses than
for the plain people whose welfare was entrusted to
him. He cared so little indeed for the rights and
wishes of the people, that he refused, for sixteen years
after he became governor, to let a new assembly be
elected. Having found in 1660 a set of pliant fol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>lowers,
he kept them in office by adjourning the assembly
from year to year.</p>

<p>Although such conduct was hard to excuse, the
people were forbearing until a great evil fell upon the
settlement. The Indians began to invade the frontier,
and used the firebrand, scalping-knife, and tomahawk
with such fearful effect that three hundred settlers
were killed and their homes burned. The people
begged Governor Berkeley to send troops to punish
the Indians; but he refused because he was carrying
on a profitable trade in furs with the offenders. At
length, five hundred men, in a frenzy of rage at their
wrongs, urged Nathaniel Bacon, a wealthy, educated
planter, to lead them against their red foes.</p>

<p>Bacon was at this time only twenty-eight years old.
Tall and graceful in person, this young man was also
brave and generous. He had sympathy with the
plain people, over whom he exerted great influence,
and when at length the Indians killed an overseer and
favorite servant on one of his large plantations, he
was willing to join with the people and be their leader
against the common foe. After trying in vain to get
a commission from Governor Berkeley, Bacon put himself
at the head of five hundred troops, and without
a commission marched boldly against the Indians.
These he defeated with very little loss.</p>

<p>In the meantime, with a force of his own soldiers,
Berkeley followed after Bacon, whom he called a rebel
and traitor. Before he could reach the young leader,
however, Berkeley had to return to Jamestown to put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
down an uprising of the people. Nor did he succeed
in restoring quiet until he agreed to an election of a
new assembly to which Bacon himself was chosen a
delegate.</p>

<p>On Bacon's return from his attack upon the Indians
he became the idol of the people. In their devotion
to him and fear for his safety, thirty men armed with
guns accompanied him on his sloop down the James
River as he went to meet with the assembly at Jamestown.
But this force was not large enough to prevent
Berkeley's followers from capturing Bacon and
taking him before the angry governor.</p>

<p>On the advice of a friend, Bacon agreed to apologize
to the governor, with the understanding, as seems
probable, that the latter should grant him the desired
commission. But the trouble between the two men
was by no means settled. That very night Bacon's
friends warned him of a plot against his life. Under
cover of darkness, therefore, he took horse, and found
safe shelter among his followers. But he speedily
returned to Jamestown at the head of five hundred
troops, where he forced Berkeley to grant him a commission,
and compelled the legislature to pass laws
that were favorable to the interests of the people.
Then hearing that the Indians were again beginning
to burn and murder on the border, he marched against
them.</p>

<p>While he was gone Berkeley called out the militia,
with the intention of overpowering Bacon upon his
return, but on learning the governor's purpose the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
troops refused to fight and went back to their homes.
Sick with the sense of failure, Governor Berkeley now
sought a place of safety across Chesapeake Bay in
Accomac County.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 649px;">
<img src="images/illus076.jpg" width="649" height="600" alt="The Burning of Jamestown." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Burning of Jamestown.</span>
</div>

<p>Bacon once more occupied Jamestown, but for a
third time found it necessary to march against the
Indians. While he was gone Berkeley, who had succeeded
in raising a troop of one thousand men, came
back and took possession of the capital. Although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Bacon's men were tired out with fighting the Indians,
they promptly gathered at his call, and attacked
Berkeley with such vigor that the poor governor was
glad to escape again to his retreat in Accomac County.</p>

<p>When Bacon got control of Jamestown, then a mere
village of some sixteen to eighteen houses, he burned
it to prevent its falling into Berkeley's hands. The
people's leader had been successful, and had risked
his life and his fortune for the common rights. But
the strain of the past four or five months in the malarial
swamps broke down his health, and after a short
illness, he died of fever at the home of a friend,
in October, 1676. It is not known where he was
buried. His friends were obliged to hide his body,
because they feared that, according to the custom of
the times, Berkeley might seize it and have it hanged.</p>

<p>With Bacon's death the rebellion lost its heart and
soul. Berkeley brutally punished Bacon's friends,
some twenty of whom he put to death. This displeased
the English king, who summoned the governor
to return to England, where he soon afterward
died a broken-hearted man.</p>

<p>Bacon's Rebellion, as this uprising of Virginians
in 1676 has been rightly called, although it seemed to
fail, was not without large influence for good. For it
strengthened the liberty-loving spirit of the people,
and prepared them for that greater movement in behalf
of their rights that took place one hundred years later.</p>

<p>Only thirteen years after Jamestown was settled,
a colony of Englishmen, very different in character
from the gold hunters of Virginia, landed on the
Massachusetts coast. These men came not to seek
fortunes but rather to establish a community with
high ideals of political and religious life. With them
they brought their wives and children, and a determination
to build for themselves permanent homes in the
new world. Before tracing their fortunes in America,
let us glance backward a few years and see them as
they were in their English homes.</p>

<p>At the present time people can choose their own
church and worship as they please, but it was not always
so, even in England. In that country, during
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, there was much religious
disturbance, and many people were punished because
they would not worship as the law required. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
were Englishmen who, while loving the English Church,
wished to make its services more simple or, as they
said, purify its forms and ceremonies. These people
were for this reason called <i>Puritans</i>. Others disliked
the ceremonial and doctrines of the Church so much
that they wished to form a separate body and worship
after their own ideas. These were called <i>Separatists</i>,
or <i>Independents</i>.</p>

<p>The Separatists met for service on the Lord's Day
in the home of William Brewster, one of their chief
men, in the little village of Scrooby. For a year they
tried to keep together and worship as an independent
body. But as the laws of England required that all
should worship in the Established Church, they found
they could not do this without being hunted down,
thrown into prison, and sometimes beaten and even
hanged.</p>

<p>They endured these persecutions as long as they
could, and then some of them decided to leave their
own land and seek a home in Holland, where they
would be free to worship God as they pleased. James
I, then King of England, being unwilling that they
should go, they had much difficulty in carrying out
their plan, but in 1608 they escaped and went to
Amsterdam. From Amsterdam they went to Leyden,
and finally from Leyden to America, by way of England.
By reason of their wanderings they became
known later as Pilgrims.</p>

<p>Since they were poor people, the Pilgrims were
obliged to accept any work that would enable them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
make a living. In Leyden many found employment
in the manufacture of woollen goods. Here they were
prosperous enough and enjoyed freedom of worship,
but were unwilling to remain with the Dutch, fearing
that their children would forget English. For,
although England had been unkind to them, they
cherished their native language, customs, and habits
of life.</p>

<p>They had heard much about the English colony in
Virginia, and the association of their own people in a
free land appealed strongly to their English hearts.
To Virginia therefore they decided to go, believing
that there they could worship in peace and harmony
and bring up their children in sturdy English thought
and feeling.</p>

<p>But it is often easier to plan than to accomplish,
and so it was with these home-yearning Pilgrims.
Having decided to leave Holland, they found practical
difficulties to be overcome, the most serious of
which were King James's opposition to their going to
America and lack of funds for the long and expensive
journey. He permitted them to sail, however,
and agreed not to disturb them in America so long
as they pleased him. After getting the king's consent
and borrowing money on hard terms, these earnest
men and women made ready to sail for their new home
in the forest wilds of America.</p>

<p>They embarked in the Speedwell, at Delft Haven, a
port twelve miles from Leyden, and sailed for Southampton,
on the south coast of England. Here they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
joined some friends who had made ready another vessel,
the now historic Mayflower. But a brief delay
was occasioned by lack of money. In order to secure
the necessary amount, about four hundred dollars, it
was necessary to sell
some of their provisions,
including much
of the butter. Funds
being secured, the two
vessels at last put to
sea, but twice returned
on account of a leak in
the Speedwell. Finally,
deeming that vessel
unseaworthy, one hundred
and two Pilgrims, including men, women, children,
and servants, took passage in the Mayflower, sailing
from Plymouth, September 16, 1620.</p>

<span class="caption">The Pilgrims in England and Holland.</span>
</div>

<p>After a most trying and tempestuous voyage lasting
over nine weeks, land was sighted, November 19,
1620, but instead of arriving off the coast of Virginia,
as they had planned, the storm-beaten voyagers found
themselves in what is now the harbor of Provincetown.
Before landing they entered into a solemn agreement
to make and obey such laws as should be needful
for the good of the colony. John Carver was chosen
governor.</p>

<p>Not being able on account of the shallow water to
get the Mayflower to a point where they could step
ashore, the men had to carry the women in their arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and wade several rods, though the weather was so cold
that their clothing, wet from the ocean spray, froze
stiff. Once on land, they fell upon their knees and
thanked God for bringing them in safety through the
many furious storms. Then immediately the women
set to work lighting fires, boiling water, and washing
clothing, while the men stood on guard to repel the
Indians in case they might make an attack.</p>

<p>It soon became clear that Cape Cod was an unfit
place for a settlement, and an exploring party, with
Miles Standish as military leader, was selected to look
for a more suitable one.</p>

<p>As military leader Miles Standish at once became
conspicuous in the life of the colony. He was born
in Lancashire, England, in 1584, of a noble family,
but was in some way deprived of his estates. Going
to the Continent he became a valiant and daring soldier
in the Netherlands. Feeling a deep interest in
the cause of the Pilgrims, he joined them when they
sailed for America in the Mayflower, and made their
fortunes his own.</p>

<p>Small of stature, quick-witted, hot-tempered, and
ready to brave any danger, this stout-hearted man was
a fitting leader for the little Pilgrim army of something
like a score of men who were obliged to defend
themselves and their families against wild beasts and
unfriendly Indians.</p>

<p>Many of the Pilgrim soldiers wore armor to protect
themselves against Indian arrows. In some instances
this armor consisted of a steel helmet and iron<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
breastplates, and in others of quilted coats of cotton
wool. Like Miles Standish, some of the soldiers had
swords at their sides, and all carried either flintlock
or matchlock muskets so big and heavy that, before
they could fire them off, they had to rest them upon
supports stuck into the ground for the purpose.</p>

<p>Standish's daring little band of soldiers explored
some of the coast on the day the Mayflower anchored.
The next Wednesday after landing they started out
a second time in search of a suitable place for settlement.
As they skirted the coast, landing here and
there, they saw and heard Indians, who fled at their
approach.</p>

<p>Soon they came upon some mounds, out of which
they dug bows and arrows and other utensils. These,
however, they replaced, because they believed the
mounds to be Indian graves. In a rude and deserted
house they also found an iron kettle. Digging into
still another mound these home-hunters were delighted
to discover large baskets filled with ears of Indian
corn&mdash;red, white, and yellow. As they were sorely in
need of food after their long voyage, they took with
them some of the corn, for which they were careful to
pay the Indians later.</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred on this otherwise
serious journey. Before they got back to the Mayflower,
William Bradford, who afterward became the
second governor of the Plymouth Colony, met with an
accident that must have caused even the stern Pilgrim
soldiers to smile. Picking his way through the un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>derbrush
of the wood he stepped unwittingly into a
deer-trap, and was suddenly jerked up into the air,
where he dangled by one leg until his friends released
him, none the worse
for the ludicrous occurrence.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 523px;">
<img src="images/illus085.jpg" width="523" height="480" alt="The Mayflower." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Mayflower.</span>
</div>

<p>After spending more
than three weeks in
vain efforts to find a
place for settlement, a
party of ten picked
men, including Governor
Carver, William
Bradford, and Captain
Miles Standish, set out
on the afternoon of December 16th, in the midst of a
driving storm, for another search. It was so cold that
the spray, falling upon them, soon covered their clothing
with coats of ice, but the voyagers, though suffering
terribly, pushed courageously forward.</p>

<p>At the close of the next day, having anchored in a
creek, they constructed a barricade, not only as a protection
from the bitter weather, but as a means of defence
against the Indians. This three-sided barricade,
made of boughs, stakes, and logs, was about as high
as a man, and was open on the leeward side. Within
this shelter they lighted a big fire, which they kept
roaring all night long. Then lying down around it,
with their feet toward the burning logs, they wrapped
their cloaks closely about them and fell asleep be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>neath
the trees and the open sky, one man always
keeping guard.</p>

<p>Next morning they were astir early, ready for the
stubborn work of another day. Some of them had
carried their muskets down to the shore, leaving them
there to be put aboard the boat a little later, and were
returning to breakfast when the shout "Indians!"
followed by a shower of arrows, greeted them. The
woods seemed full of red warriors, whose blood-curdling
war-whoops must have struck fear to the hearts
of the small band of explorers. However, the white
men bravely stood their ground, and with cool arm
and steady hand so terrified the savages that they
soon took to their heels.</p>

<p>Once out to sea again the Pilgrims encountered a
furious gale that threatened to swamp their frail boat.
All day long they were tossed about on the storm-swept
sea, and just before dark an immense wave
almost filled the boat and carried off the rudder. A
little later a fierce gust of wind broke the mast into
three pieces. Then without mast or rudder the dauntless
men struggled at the oars until morning when they
reached land and found themselves on an island which
they named Clarke's Island, in honor of the Mayflower's
mate.</p>

<p>Some further explorations revealed a suitable place
for settlement. It had a good harbor, a stream of excellent
drinking water near by, and at a little distance
from the shore a stretch of high ground affording a
good location for a fort. In addition to these advan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>tages
there was a large field of cleared land on which
the Indians had raised corn. Much cheered with their
discovery the explorers returned with their report.</p>

</div>

<p>After as little delay as possible, the Pilgrims landed<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
on the spot chosen for
their new home,&mdash;the spot
which John Smith had
several years before named
Plymouth. At once they
set to work with heroic
energy, some felling trees,
some sawing, some splitting,
and some carrying
logs to the places of
building.</p>


<p>They first erected a
rude log-house, twenty feet
square, which would serve for a common storehouse,
for shelter, and for other purposes, and began the
building of five separate private dwellings. They built
also a hospital and a meeting-house.</p>

<p>The houses were all alike in form and size. After
cutting down trees and sawing logs of suitable length,
the men dragged them by hand along the ground&mdash;for
there were no horses or other beasts of burden&mdash;and
laid them one upon another, thus forming the
walls. Probably the chimneys and fireplaces were of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>stone, the crevices being plastered with mortar made
by mixing straw and mud, and oil paper taking the
place of glass for windows. At the best, these log-houses
were poor makeshifts for dwellings in the
severe winter weather along the bleak New England
coast.</p>

<p>For furnishing these simple homes, the Pilgrims
had brought over such articles as large arm-chairs,
wooden settles, high-posted beds, truckle-beds for
young children, and cradles for babies. Every home
had also its spinning-wheel. The cooking was done
in a big fireplace. Here the housewife baked bread
in large ovens, roasted meat by putting it on iron spits
which they had to keep turning in order to cook all
sides of the roast alike, and boiled various kinds of
food in large kettles hung over the fire.</p>

<p>As there were no friction matches in those days, it
was the custom to kindle a fire by striking sparks with
a flint and steel into dry tinder-stuff. Having once
started a fire,&mdash;which was no easy matter,&mdash;they had to
be very careful not to let it go out, and for that reason
covered the coals at bedtime with ashes.</p>

<p>In the place of candles or lamps, pitch-pine knots
furnished light at night. We can well imagine the
Pilgrim boys and girls resting on the settles in the
evening, and reading by the blaze from the huge fireplace.</p>

<p>In this first winter lack of good food and warm
clothing, exposure to the cold, and various kinds of
hardship bred disease in the little colony. At one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
time only seven men were well enough to take care of
the sick and suffering. One of these seven was the
fearless soldier, Miles Standish. He now became a
tender nurse, and joined with William Bradford and
Elder Brewster in making fires, washing clothes, cooking
food, and in other plain household duties.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<span class="caption">A Matchlock Gun.</span>
</div>

<p>By spring about half of the colonists, including
Governor Carver and Rose Standish, wife of Captain
Miles Standish, had died. Notwithstanding all the
sufferings, however, not one of the Pilgrims went back
on the Mayflower when she sailed for England. But
so weak had the colony become through loss of able-bodied
men, that corn was planted on the graves to
keep the Indians from learning how many had died.</p>

<p>One day in early spring, the Pilgrims were startled
by the sudden appearance of an Indian, Samoset by
name, who cried in English, "Welcome, Englishmen."
A week later he returned with a friend, named
Squanto,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who had formerly lived at Plymouth with
other Indians, all of whom had been swept away by a
plague.</p>

<p>Squanto was glad to get back to his old home once
more. He afterward came to live with the Pilgrims,
acting as their messenger and interpreter and showing
them how to hunt and how to catch fish. From him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>they learned how to plant corn. Putting one or two
herring as a fertilizer in every hill, they would watch
for a while to prevent the wolves from digging up and
eating the fish, and in due time would have an abundant
return.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 634px;">
<img src="images/illus090.jpg" width="634" height="480" alt="A Group of Pilgrim Relics." title="" />
<span class="caption">A Group of Pilgrim Relics.</span>
</div>

<p>About a week after Samoset's first appearance, he
returned and announced the approach of Massasoit,
an Indian chief living at Mount Hope, some forty
miles southwest of Plymouth. Captain Miles Standish
marched out with his men to escort the Indian chief
to meet Governor Carver in an unfinished house.
The Pilgrims had spread upon the floor a green mat,
which they covered with cushions for the chief and the
governor. When the chief, who was a man of fine
presence and dignified bearing, was seated upon the
cushions, Governor Carver was escorted to the place
of meeting by the Pilgrim soldiers, amid the beating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of drums and the blowing of trumpets. After the
governor had kissed the chief's hand, the two men
agreed to be friends and keep peace between the white
men and the red. The friendship thus romantically
begun lasted for more than fifty years. Before Massasoit's
departure the Pilgrims gave him two skins
and a copper necklace.</p>

<p>As summer came on the condition of the Pilgrims
improved. There was much less sickness, and food
was more easily obtained. On the arrival of autumn
the corn and barley planted by the Pilgrims yielded a
good return, and ducks, geese, wild turkeys, and deer
could be secured by hunting. When Massasoit with
ninety men came to see the Pilgrims in the autumn,
the Indians brought some deer and the Pilgrims furnished
food from their supplies, so that a three days'
feast was held. This was the first celebration of the
New England Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>But not all of the Indian neighbors were so friendly
as Massasoit and his tribe. Canonicus, chief of the
Narragansetts, sent to Plymouth an insolent greeting
in the form of a number of arrows tied with a snake's
skin. The Pilgrims on their part stuffed the snake's
skin full of powder and bullets, and in defiance sent
it back to Canonicus. So deeply impressed were the
Indians by this fearless act that they let the whites
alone.</p>

<p>Believing it wise to be prepared against Indian
attacks, however, the Pilgrims surrounded the settlement
with palisades, and erected on "Burial Hill" a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
building, on the flat roof of which cannon were placed,
the room downstairs serving as a meeting-house.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 616px;">
<img src="images/illus092.jpg" width="616" height="600" alt="Pilgrims Returning from Church." title="" />
<span class="caption">Pilgrims Returning from Church.</span>
</div>

<p>Energetic in practical affairs, they were equally zealous
in religious observance; for they were very regular
in their church attendance. Their Sabbaths began
with sundown on Saturday and lasted until sundown
on Sunday. The beating of a drum on Sunday morning
was the signal for the men to meet at the door of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Captain Miles Standish's house, from which they
marched three abreast, followed by their governor in
a long robe, with the minister on his right and Miles
Standish on his left.</p>

<p>After the men came the women, then the children,
and last of all the servants. On entering the church
they sat in order of rank, the old men in one part of
the church, the young men in another, mothers with
their little children in a third, young women in a
fourth, and the boys in a fifth.</p>

<p>The services lasted all the morning; then, after an
intermission for lunch at noon, they began again and
continuing all the afternoon. But on the coldest days
of winter only foot-stoves were used to heat the meeting-house.
Nor was this the only discomfort the Pilgrims
had in their church worship. For even these
good people found it sometimes hard to remain awake
during the long services. And it was the duty of
the constable to see that all kept their eyes open. If
this official saw a boy asleep he rapped him with the
end of a wand; if he saw a woman nodding he brushed
her gently with a hare's foot, which was on the other
end of the wand.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims held their town meetings in the meeting-house,
where they held their religious services.
At town meetings all the men wore their hats. In
voting they used corn and beans, a grain of corn
meaning yes and a bean meaning no.</p>

<p>Such was the life of the little company of true-hearted
men and women at Plymouth. Small in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
number as they were, they remained brave in spirit,
amid surroundings which tested all their powers of
endurance. For several years Miles Standish did
valiant service there, and then went to live at Duxbury,
where he was soon joined by some of his Pilgrim
friends, among whom was John Alden. Here the good
captain remained the rest of his life, except when he
was needed as military leader by the colony. He died
many years later,&mdash;in 1656,&mdash;leaving behind him a
good name with the Pilgrims and the rest of the world.</p>

<p>For years after the landing of the Pilgrims at
Plymouth (1620) their number grew so slowly
that by 1630 the population was only three hundred.
After that year they began to increase more
rapidly, by reason of neighboring settlements made by
the Puritans at various places on the Massachusetts
coast.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the Puritans in England
were dissatisfied with the English Church, and that
they wished to purify some of its forms and beliefs.
But they did not succeed in their purpose because the
Stuart Kings of England, James I. and Charles I., bitterly
opposed the Puritan movement. For a long time
the Puritans held their meetings secretly in such out-of-the-way
places as private houses and barns. At
length, encouraged by the success of the Pilgrims at
Plymouth, they decided to leave their homes in old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
England and try to form a new England across the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>These Puritans were not, like the Pilgrims, poor
men of little influence, for some of them had been
educated at Oxford or Cambridge, some were wealthy,
and some were connected with distinguished families.
All were of sterling character, ready to undergo hardship
for the sake of their religion.</p>

<p>In 1628, therefore, some of the leading Puritans
formed a trading company and, having bought a tract
of land in America from the Plymouth Company, sent
out settlers to occupy it. The first settlement was at
Salem with Endicott as leader. Two years later eleven
vessels sailed with nearly 1,000 Puritans, bringing with
them horses, cattle, and stores of various kinds. They
located at Boston, Dorchester, Charlestown, and other
towns near Boston. John Winthrop, their leader, was
the first governor.</p>

<p>Each of these settlements constituted a township,
which usually included an area of from forty to sixty
square miles. Within this tract settlers lived in villages,
in the centre of which stood their meeting-house,
used not only for a place of worship but for all kinds
of public meetings. Near the meeting-house stood the
block-house. This was a rude, strongly built structure,
where the people of the village could take refuge in
case of attack from Indians.</p>

<p>Extending through each village was a long street, and
on either side of it stood the settlers' dwellings with
their small farms stretching back in the rear. These<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
dwellings, which in early years were only log huts,
afterward gave place to high-roofed frame houses.
All were simple, solid, and neat.</p>

<span class="caption">Roger Williams on his Way to Visit the Chief of the Narragansett Indians.</span>
</div>

<p>Upon entering one of these early Puritan homes we
should find two principal rooms, the "best room"
and the kitchen. In the kitchen the thing of special
interest to us would be the fireplace, large enough for
a back-log five or six feet long and two or three feet
thick. In this great fireplace a Puritan housewife
could roast an entire sheep. As stoves were unknown
in these olden days, all cooking was done
at this open fire, and it was by such firesides that
the Puritan boys and girls used to spend the long
winter evenings. While the logs blazed the mother
and daughters would knit, or spin, or quilt, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
father would read his Bible or smoke his pipe. At
this family hearth there was also much good cheer
in cider-drinking, nut-cracking, and story-telling, especially
when the family was fortunate enough to have
a stranger present as a
guest. At such times
the children were always
good listeners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 608px;">
<img src="images/illus099.jpg" width="608" height="480" alt="Block House" title="" />
<span class="caption">Block House</span>
</div>

<p>But much as it was
prized, a visit from a
stranger was a rare occurrence,
for as there
were no carriages or public
conveyances of any
kind, long journeys were seldom made. When travelling
by land the settlers sometimes went on foot and
sometimes on horseback. In the latter case the men
sat in front and the women on a pillion behind. For
carrying supplies, sleds were used in winter and ox-carts
in summer.</p>

<p>Since travel was so difficult, there was very little
communication between distant villages unless they
happened to touch upon the sea. But frequently this
was not the case, for many of the settlements, following
the courses of rivers, extended inland rather than
along the coast.</p>

<p>When a stranger did appear, however, he was always
welcome, for he was sure to bring some bit of news
from the world outside. Perhaps, if he had travelled
through the woods, he might tell of some dangerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
adventure with wild beasts or Indians. If in midwinter
he dared to make the journey, he might tell how he
spent a cold night in some deserted wigwam, into which
he had been driven by howling wolves. Such thrilling
chapters from the book of every-day life were of special
interest to people whose experience was very narrow
and monotonous. For in those days there were no
newspapers and few books.</p>

<p>We should make a great mistake, however, were we
to imagine that the Puritans did not value books and
reading. They appreciated reading and education so
much that every town was required to have a school.
As a consequence of this excellent system, there were
very few people who could not read and write.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 491px;">
<img src="images/illus100.jpg" width="491" height="480" alt="Roger Williams's Meeting-House." title="" />
<span class="caption">Roger Williams's Meeting-House.</span>
</div>

<p>The study of the Bible was an important feature
in all this school training, and absorbed much of the
thought of the Puritan mind,
especially on the Sabbath.
The Puritan Sabbath, which
began at sunset on Saturday
and ended at sunset on
Sunday, was largely given
up to church worship. All
work and travel, not absolutely
necessary, were suspended,
and no playing on
a musical instrument was allowed.
Two instances will illustrate the severity of
the Puritan ideas of Sabbath observation. The first is
that of two lovers, who were brought to trial because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
they were seen sitting together on the Lord's Day
under an apple-tree. The second tells us of a Boston
sea-captain who was put into the public stocks for two
hours because he kissed his wife on the Sabbath Day
upon the doorsteps of his house. He had just returned
after a two years' absence on a sea-voyage.</p>

<p>In all this strictness about Sabbath observance, the
Puritans were wholly sincere. To them purity of religion
was the supreme interest of life. They had left
their old homes in England that they might worship
according to their own belief in a community under
the control of Puritan ideas.</p>

<p>But it was no easy matter for them to arrange the
affairs of Church and State just as they wished, even
in this new Puritan commonwealth. For they found
some of the settlers unwilling to believe and act in accordance
with Puritan ideas of right and wrong.</p>

<p>One of these troublesome persons was a young man
who came with his bride to Salem in 1631. This
young man was Roger Williams. He was born in
England in 1599. An Englishman of influence secured
for the clever lad a scholarship in the Charter-House
school, from which young Roger later went to
Cambridge University. Having become a Puritan,
Roger Williams, like so many others of his faith, found
it wise to leave England. He came to America in order
that he might escape religious persecution and enjoy
religious freedom.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/illus102.jpg" width="404" height="336" alt="A Puritan Fireplace." title="" />
<span class="caption">A Puritan Fireplace.</span>
</div>

<p>On reaching New England he went to Salem, and
was there appointed a minister of the church. After<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
a very short time he left Salem, and went with his
family to Plymouth. Remaining there for two years,
he became deeply interested in the Indians, and began
the difficult task of learning their language. He wrote
afterward, "God was pleased to give me a painful,
patient spirit to lodge with them in their filthy, smoky
holes to gain their tongue."</p>

<p>In this way he acquired a good knowledge of the
Indians, whom he learned to love and who learned
to love him. Little
did he realize that
this warm friendship
would in after years
save not only his own
life but also the lives
of many other Puritans.</p>

<p>While winning the
friendship of the Indians,
Roger Williams
incensed the Puritans
by saying in strong language that they had no just
claim to the lands they were living on. He said that
the King had no right to grant to any company these
lands, because they had never belonged to him. The
Indians, and only the Indians, owned them. It is
needless to say that such arguments made many bitter
enemies for the youthful preacher.</p>

<p>Of course he could not continue in this severe criticism
of matters so important to the Puritan heart with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>out
losing many of his friends. The wrath of the
Puritans at length became so great that they tried him
in court and banished him from Massachusetts. As
he became ill about this time, however, he was told
that he might remain in the
colony through the winter if
he would not preach. But
as soon as he grew better his
friends, who were very fond
of him, began to spend much
time in talking with him at
his home in Salem, where he
now lived. The Puritans,
fearing his influence, determined
to send him at once
to England.</p>

<span class="caption">The Rhode Island Settlement.</span>
</div>

<p>When the heroic young
minister heard of this, he
hastily said good-by to his wife and two children&mdash;one
of whom was a little girl two years old and the other
a baby&mdash;and looked for safety in the home of his old
friend Massasoit, living near Mount Hope, seventy or
eighty miles away.</p>

<p>The outlook was dreary enough. It was midwinter
(January, 1636), and the snow was lying deep upon
the ground. As there was no road cut through the
forest, Roger Williams had to depend upon his compass
for a guide. To keep himself from freezing, he
carried with him a hatchet to chop kindling wood, and
a flint and steel to kindle it into flame. Thus fitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
out, he started, though still weak from his recent illness,
with a staff in his hand and a pack on his back,
to look for his dusky friend, Massasoit. This long
journey in the bitter weather of a New England winter
was indeed a trying experience to the lonely traveller.
He wrote long afterward, "Steering my course, in winter
snow, I was sorely tossed for one fourteen weeks
in a bitter winter season, not knowing what bed or
bread did mean." Having found Massasoit, he spent
much of the winter in the wigwam kindly furnished
him by the Indian chief.</p>

<p>In the spring he began to erect buildings at Seekonk
on land given him by the Indians. But his friend,
Governor Winthrop, having secretly sent him word
that Seekonk was in the territory belonging to the
Massachusetts colony, he decided to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he and five of his friends rowed down
the river and, landing at a place pointed out by the
Indians as having a spring of good water, made a
settlement, which they called Providence, in token of
God's watchful care over them. This was the beginning
of Rhode Island, a colony where all men, whatever
their religious belief might be, were welcome.
Men who had been persecuted elsewhere on account of
their religion were glad to go to Rhode Island, where
they were allowed to worship as they pleased. And
thus it soon grew to be a prosperous settlement.</p>

<p>Roger Williams was a man of pure and noble soul.
He did not seem to bear any grudge against the people
of Massachusetts. For when, in 1637, the Pequots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
tried to get the Narragansett Indians to join them in
a general uprising against the whites, and especially
against those living in Massachusetts, he did all he
could to frustrate their plans. At this time he set out
one stormy day in his canoe to visit Canonicus, chief
of the Narragansetts, and succeeded, at the risk of his
life, in preventing the union of the two tribes against
the whites.</p>

<p>He died in 1683 at the age of eighty-four years.
Although his judgment was not always wise, his motives
were upright. In his struggle with the Puritans
he was ahead of his age, which was not yet ready for
such advanced ideas of religious toleration.</p>

<p>The Pilgrims and Puritans were not the only
people who had to suffer persecution in England
because they did not believe in the doctrines and
forms of worship of the Established Church. Under
the leadership of George Fox there sprang up (about
1669) a peculiar religious sect called by themselves
Friends and by others Quakers. These people were
severely punished on account of their religious ideas.</p>

<p>The central doctrine of their creed was that they
were in all things led by the "inner light," as they
called conscience, which revealed to them the will of
God. Believing that all men were equal before the
law, the Quaker always kept his hat on in public
places as a sign of equality, refusing to uncover even
in the presence of royalty. Other peculiar tenets of
the Quakers were their unwillingness to take an oath
in court; to go to war; to pay taxes in support of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
war; the use of "thee" and "thou" in addressing
one another; and, as a protest against the rich and
elegant dress of their time, the wearing of plain clothes
of sober colors.</p>

<p>Their disdain of familiar customs made them appear
very eccentric, and their boldness of speech and action
frequently brought upon them the punishment of the
law. But they were fearless in their defiance, and even
eager to suffer for the sake of their religious belief,
some being fined, some cast into prison, some whipped,
and some put to death. Not only in England, but in
Massachusetts also, they were treated like criminals.
The Puritan fathers hated and feared them so much
that they banished Quakers from their colony, and even
put some of them to death on account of their views on
religion and government. But, as always, persecution
only seemed to spread the faith, and soon this derided
and abused sect included eminent converts.</p>

<p>Among the most prominent was William Penn, who
was born in London in 1644, the son of Sir William
Penn, a wealthy admiral in the British Navy. Conspicuous
service to his country had won him great
esteem at Court, and he naturally desired to give his
son the best possible advantages.</p>

<p>At the early age of sixteen, young William was sent
to Oxford, where his studious habits and fine scholarship
soon distinguished him. He became proficient in
Greek and Latin, and learned to speak with ease the
modern languages, French, German, Italian, and Dutch.
Devoting a part of his time to athletics, he became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
a skilful oarsman and a leader in various out-door
sports.</p>

<p>While he was at Oxford, Penn heard Thomas Loe,
a travelling Quaker, preach. The new doctrines, as
expounded by Loe, took so deep a hold upon him,
that he refused to attend the religious services of his
college.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> For this irregularity he was fined, together
with some of his companions who were of the same
mind. Disregarding the reproof, these conscientious
young men even refused to wear the required college
gown, and committed a yet graver offence against their
college by tearing off the gowns from some of their
fellow-students.</p>

<p>By reason of these bold and unruly proceedings the
college authorities expelled Penn in disgrace. His
father was very angry at what he deemed his son's
folly, and knowing that neither rebuke nor persuasion
was likely to swerve the young man from his purpose,
Admiral Penn decided to send William to Paris, with
the hope that in the gay life of the French capital he
might forget his Quaker ideas.</p>

<p>Penn was now a strongly built young man of eighteen,
with large eyes and long dark hair falling in curls
about his shoulders. For a brief time he gave himself
up to the fashionable social life of Paris. Later he
engaged in study at school for something like a year,
and then spent another year in travelling through
France and Italy. When he returned to England after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>two years' absence, he was a cultivated young gentleman,
very different from the sober youth who on leaving
Oxford had been called by his companions "a
Quaker or some other melancholy thing."</p>

<span class="caption">WILLIAM PENN'S FAMOUS TREATY WITH THE INDIANS.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>The
following year, however, Penn's gay spirits
were disturbed by the awful plague that fell upon
London. The Admiral, noting the serious look and
manner of his son, again sent him from home&mdash;this
time to Ireland&mdash;for diversion. While Penn was in
Ireland an insurrection broke out, and he volunteered
as a soldier. Military life evidently appealed to him,
for he caused a portrait of himself to be painted, in
full armor.</p>

<p>While still serving as a soldier, Penn learned that
the Quaker, Thomas Loe, was preaching near by, and
went to hear him once more. The Quaker ideas now
took complete possession of him, and he embraced the
new religion with his whole heart. A little later, when
he was arrested in a Quaker meeting-house and thrown
into prison, his father was indignant because William
had brought upon his family such humiliating disgrace.</p>

<p>After William's release from prison, however, the
stern old Admiral in his great love for his son said he
would forgive his peculiar customs if only he would
remove his hat to his father, to the King, or to the
Duke of York. But on praying over the matter, Penn
said he could not do it. One day, on meeting the
King, he had the boldness to stand with his hat on in
the royal presence. Instead of getting angry, the fun-loving
King Charles laughed and took off his own hat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
"Why dost thou remove thy hat, friend Charles?" said
William Penn. "Because," answered the King, "wherever
I am it is customary for one to remain uncovered."</p>

<p>But the Admiral's patience was by this time exhausted.
He drove
his wilful son from
his presence, and
told him to begone
for all time. Fortunately
for William,
his mother
begged for him,
and so did others
who recognized the
earnest and sincere
purpose of the
young Quaker. His father therefore forgave him
once more, and allowed him to return home.</p>

<span class="caption">The Pennsylvania Settlement.</span>
</div>

<p>From this time on William Penn used his influence&mdash;which
was by no means small&mdash;in behalf of the persecuted
Quakers; but he had to suffer the consequences
of his own fearlessness. Many times was he thrown
into prison, there to remain, it might be, for months.
Yet even in prison he spent his time in writing books
and pamphlets, explaining and defending the Quaker
religion. Indeed, his labors were unceasing, so firm
was his faith in Quaker ideas.</p>

<p>Soon his power for doing good was immensely increased.
In 1670 his father died and left him a
princely fortune which, true to his generous nature, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
determined to use for the good of others, and especially
for the good of the despised and persecuted Quakers.</p>

<p>The Crown owed Penn's father about &pound;16,000,
which the King, with his extravagant habits, was not
likely to pay for many a
day. William Penn, therefore,
decided to ask the
King to pay the debt not
in money but in land.
The good-natured Charles,
thinking this was an easy
way to cancel the obligation,
readily granted to
William Penn an extensive tract of land lying on the
west side of the Delaware River.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 615px;">
<img src="images/illus113.jpg" width="615" height="480" alt="Penn's Slate-roof House, Philadelphia." title="" />
<span class="caption">Penn's Slate-roof House, Philadelphia.</span>
</div>

<p>Penn wished his new possession to be called Sylvania,
or Woodland, but the King insisted upon calling
it Pennsylvania, in honor of Penn's father. Upon
receiving his grant, Penn at once sent word to the
Quakers that in Pennsylvania they could find a home
and a resting-place from their troubles.</p>

<p>Penn's leading aim was to plant a self-governing
colony, whose people should have justice and religious
freedom. Hundreds of Quakers eagerly took advantage
of the favorable opportunity which Penn thus
offered to them. During the year 1681, when the
first settlement was planted in Pennsylvania, something
like 3,000 of them sailed for the Delaware River. The
next year Penn himself sailed for America, although
he left his wife and children behind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>He selected the junction of the Delaware and Schuylkill
rivers as the site for his city, and called it Philadelphia,
or the City of Brotherly Love, in token of the
spirit which he hoped might prevail throughout his
colony. He laid out the city most carefully, giving
the streets such names as Pine, Cedar, Mulberry, Walnut,
and Chestnut, after the trees he found growing
there.</p>

<p>When the first settlers came to Philadelphia, some
of them lived in caves which they dug in the high
river-banks. The first houses, built of logs, were
very simple, containing only two rooms and having
no floor except the earth. Philadelphia grew so
fast, however, that by 1684 it had 357 houses, many
of which were three stories high, with cellars and
balconies.</p>

<span class="caption">A Belt of Wampum Given to Penn by the Indians.</span>
</div>

<p>As we might expect from a man of his even temper
and unselfish spirit, Penn treated the Indians with
kindness and justice, and won their friendship from the
first. Although he held the land by a grant from the
King of England, still he wished to satisfy the natives
by paying them for
their claims to the
land. Accordingly, he
called a council under
the spreading branches
of a now famous elm-tree,
where he met the red men as friends, giving
them knives, kettles, axes, beads, and various other
things in exchange for the land. He declared that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
he was of the same flesh and blood as they; and
highly pleased, the Indians in return declared that
they would live in love with William Penn as long as
the sun and moon should shine.</p>

<p>Penn paid the Indians friendly visits, ate their
roasted acorns and hominy, and joined them in their
sports. One day while they were leaping and jumping
in his presence, he suddenly "sprang up and beat
them all."</p>

<p>Penn soon returned to England, but many years
later (1699) he came back to Pennsylvania with his
wife and one daughter. As he was very wealthy, he
had two homes, one in the city and another in the
country. His country home, which was northeast of
the city on the Delaware River, cost him $35,000. In
this house were elegant furnishings, and here, in his
large dining-hall, Penn lavishly entertained Englishmen,
Swedes, Indians, negroes, and passing strangers
who called at his door. We are told that his table
was so bountiful that at one of his feasts the guests
ate a hundred roast turkeys. The grounds about his
country home were magnificent, containing various
kinds of fruits and flowers, and in his stables were
many horses.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding these material blessings, Penn's
life was not without trials and disappointments, which
it is needless to dwell upon. Owing to his warm
friendship for King James, he was suspected of plotting
in his favor after the King was forced to leave
England in 1688. He was therefore more than once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
arrested, but in every case he was set free for lack of
evidence against him. Many years later, on his refusal
to pay a false claim made by his steward, he was thrown
into prison, where his health was broken by confinement.
He died in 1718. His life had been a hard
struggle, but it had been successful, and had come to
an honorable close.</p>

<p>The same year in which William Penn laid out
Philadelphia and there made a treaty with the
Indians, a noted Frenchman sailed down the Mississippi
River, exploring it in the interests of France.
This man was Robert Cavelier, Better known as La
Salle, who, like many of his countrymen, was trying,
just as the Spaniards and Englishmen had tried, to find
or do something in America that would not only
bring glory to his own name, but also wealth and
honor to his fatherland.  We have now to consider the
work of the French in America.</p>

<p>In 1534 Cartier, a French explorer, discovered the
St. Lawrence, and sailed up the river as far as an
Indian village on the present site of Montreal. He
took possession of Canada in the name of the French
King, and his favorable reports led to several unsuccessful
attempts to plant settlements there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>More than seventy years after the discovery of the
St. Lawrence, another French explorer, Samuel de
Champlain, sailed up the noble river. Much impressed
with the great beauty of the St. Lawrence Valley
and its wealth of forests and furs, he longed to
bring all this vast new country under the control of
France. In 1608 he planted the first permanent
French settlement in Canada, at Quebec, and the
following year discovered the lake which bears his
name.</p>

<p>Although Champlain loved his country and desired
to increase its glory and power, he made an unfortunate
blunder, which
proved fatal to the best
interests of France in the
New World. In planting
the settlement at Quebec,
in 1608, he found
that the neighboring tribes of Algonquin Indians were
bitter enemies of the Mohawks, one of the Five Nations,
or Iroquois, who lived in New York.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illus119.jpg" width="640" height="284" alt="Long House of the Iroquois." title="" />
<span class="caption">Long House of the Iroquois.</span>
</div>

<p>The Algonquins begged him to join them in an
attack upon the Mohawks, and he unwisely consented.
Having gone up Lake Champlain with a canoe-party
of sixty Indians, he landed near the site of Ticonderoga
to fight a battle with two hundred hardy
Mohawk warriors. Champlain, clad in light armor
and gun in hand, advanced at the head of his war-party
and, shooting into the ranks of the astonished
Mohawks, who stood in battle array, brought to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
earth two of their chiefs. The others fled in terror
and confusion, while their enemies, Champlain's dusky
allies, yelled with joy, and filled the woods with their
terrible warwhoops.</p>

<p>From that day, however, the Iroquois were the
bitter enemies of the French, and this enmity seriously
interfered with the successful carrying out of French
plans. Having control of the St. Lawrence River,
France greatly desired to get control of the Mississippi
River as well. Once securing possession of these two
great streams, she would come into possession of the
wealth of the North American Continent.</p>

<p>But the Iroquois Indians were strongly posted in
the Mohawk River Valley, and thus held the key to
the situation. In this way they blocked the path of
the French, who wished to reach the Ohio and the
Mississippi through Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
So the French were driven to seek a route farther
north, a route which was much longer and more difficult.
It would be well for you to trace on your map
this roundabout way, which extended up the Ottawa
River into Georgian Bay, through Lake Huron and
Lake Michigan, across into the Illinois River, and
through that into the Mississippi.</p>

<p>In the same year that Champlain made the Iroquois
bitter enemies of the French, Henry Hudson won
their lasting friendship for the Dutch. About the
time the Frenchman was fighting in the battle against
the Mohawks at Ticonderoga, Hudson, with a crew of
twenty men in the Half Moon, was sailing up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
river that now bears his name. Instead of finding the
short passage to the Pacific, for which he was searching
in the interests of the Dutch, he discovered the
great water-way to the interior. Having received just
treatment from him, the Iroquois Indians became his
friends and the friends of the Dutch settlers and
traders that came later.</p>

<p>From that time, in fact, these Iroquois Indians were
as ready to sell their furs to the Dutch and to the
English, who in 1664 took New York away from the
Dutch, as they were to oppose the French and compel
them to go many hundred miles out of their way
in the tedious explorations in search of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>This toilsome work of exploration was largely
accomplished by the Jesuit missionaries. Fearless in
their heroic efforts to advance their faith, they suffered
all sorts of hardships, many being put to death, in
their earnest struggle to bring religious truth to the
ignorant red men of the woods. In their journeys
through the forests and over the lakes, these Jesuit
Fathers made many valuable discoveries and explorations
which they carefully recorded in their journals.</p>

<p>It was one of these missionaries, Father Marquette,
who succeeded in reaching the waters of the Mississippi.
Attended by Joliet and five other Frenchmen,
he went, in 1673, as far down the mighty river as the
mouth of the Arkansas. This was sixty-five years after
Champlain made his settlement at Quebec.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>But the most important of all the French explorations
were made by the daring and tireless La Salle.
He was born in France in 1643, and belonged to an
old and rich family. Strong in mind and character,
he received a good education, and became an earnest
Catholic. With a heart ready to brave any danger in
the achievement of glory for himself and for France,
this young man at the age of twenty-three sailed for
Canada.</p>

<p>His plans, as finally worked out, were twofold:
(1) To build forts and trading centres at various points
along the St. Lawrence, the Great Lakes, and the
Mississippi; and (2) to plant a colony at the mouth
of the Mississippi. Wishing to get control of the rich
fur trade for France, his forts and his colony would
help to protect and further this trade, which could be
carried on more easily by way of the Mississippi, than
by way of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence. For
along the latter route lay the hostile Iroquois, who
were friendly to the Dutch and the English; and,
moreover, the St. Lawrence was ice-bound nearly one-half
of the year.</p>

<p>Early in August, 1679, after long and weary efforts
spent in preparation, La Salle launched on the Niagara
River above the Falls, his little vessel, the Griffin, of
forty tons burden, which was to bear him through the
lakes on his way to the Mississippi.</p>

<p>Nearly a year before starting, La Salle had sent up
the lakes fifteen men to trade for furs. He expected
them to have ready, against the time of his arrival, a
cargo of furs to be sent back to Canada. For La Salle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
needed a great deal of money with which to buy provisions,
ammunition, and tools, and to pay his men
for their services. Besides, he wished to get cables,
anchors, and rigging for a new vessel to be built on
the Illinois River, for the purpose of making his expedition
to the mouth of the Mississippi. The expected
cargo of furs, taken back and sold in Canada,
would give him the money he needed to carry out his
plans.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the head of Lake Huron, therefore,
he collected the cargo awaiting him, loaded the
Griffin with furs, and on September 18, 1679, despatched
it in charge of six men to Niagara. La Salle
himself pushed on to the mouth of the St. Joseph
River, where he built a fort, and waited long and anxiously
for the Griffin's return. But he waited in vain,
for he never heard from his vessel again. It was a
great loss and a keen disappointment. After waiting
long he continued his way, careworn and weary, with
eight canoes and a party of thirty-three men.</p>

<p>They rowed up the St. Joseph in search of the carrying-place
leading to the head-waters of the Illinois
River. On landing, La Salle started off alone to look
for the pathway. In the midst of a blinding snow-storm
he lost his bearings in the dense forest, and
wandered until about two o'clock in the morning, when
he found himself once more at the river, and fired his
gun as a signal to the party.</p>

<p>Then his eyes caught the welcome sight of a fire
burning in the woods. Believing he was near his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
friends, he quickened his steps, only to find himself
mistaken. Near the fire, under a tree, was a bed of
dried grass which was still warm, and showed plainly
that a man had but a few minutes before been lying
there. Very likely the man was an Indian, who had
been frightened off by the sound of the gun. La Salle
carefully placed brush for a sort of barricade on each
side of the newly found bed, and then lay down by the
blazing fire and slept till daybreak. He did not find
his friends until four o'clock next afternoon.</p>

<p>On rejoining his party they made their way down
the Illinois River, until their eyes fell upon some Indian
wigwams on the forest-covered bank. The Indians,
being friendly, received the Frenchmen with generous
hospitality. They urged La Salle not to go down the
Mississippi. They indeed said so much of the danger
of the journey that six of La Salle's followers deserted,
and another tried to poison him. These were
sad days for La Salle and, like all his days, were beset
with troubles and dangers. To protect himself from
attack during the winter, he now planned the building
of a fort which he called Cr&egrave;vec&#339;ur, the French word
for heartbreak, surely a fitting name.</p>

<p>Up to this time the iron-willed La Salle had not
given up hope of hearing from the Griffin, but now he
decided that his vessel was lost. There was but one
thing to do. He must make an overland journey to
Canada, 1,500 miles away, to get supplies for his expedition
down the Mississippi. It was a dangerous
undertaking. But on March 1, 1680, with an Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
hunter and four Frenchmen, the dauntless explorer
started in two canoes.</p>

<p>The season was the worst in the year for such a
journey. The ground was covered with melting snow,
and the rivers in many places were frozen with ice, too
thick to be broken by the boats. Much of the time
the party had to pull the canoes on rough sleds overland
or carry them on their shoulders until, a few days
after starting, they hid them in the woods and pushed
forward on foot to the head of Lake Michigan.</p>

<p>Reaching that point, it was now necessary for them
to thread their toilsome way through the deep forests
of Southern Michigan to the head of Lake Erie. For
three days the undergrowth was so thick with thorns
that it tore their clothing into shreds, and scratched
their faces until they were covered with blood. Another
three days were spent in wading, sometimes up to
their waists, in the mud and water of the flood-covered
marshes. At night they would take off their clothing
and, covering their bodies with blankets, lie down to
sleep on some dry hillock. One frosty night their
clothes froze so stiff that in the morning they had to
be thawed by the fireside before they could be put on.
Amid such exposure some of the men fell sick, and
thus delayed the party. But early in May, at the end
of sixty-five days, they reached Canada.</p>

<p>As soon as he could arrange his affairs in Canada,
La Salle again returned to the Illinois River and
reached its mouth. But owing to fresh disappointments,
he had to make still another journey through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
the wilderness to the base of his supplies on the St.
Lawrence.</p>

<p>Not until February 6, 1682, two years and a half
after he first started out in the Griffin, and after three
attempts to build a suitable vessel for the journey, did
he float out upon the waters of the Mississippi to explore
it; and at last he was obliged to make the journey
in canoes. This time his party included fifty-four
people&mdash;eighteen Indian warriors, ten squaws, three
Indian children, and twenty-three Frenchmen. On
reaching the mouth of the river he planted a column
bearing the arms of France, and then, with imposing
ceremonies, took possession of the great Mississippi
Valley in the name of the French King, Louis XIV.,
after whom he named the country Louisiana.</p>

<p>By building forts and trading centres along his route,
La Salle had carried out the first part of his plan. He
now resolved to go to France and get men for a colony
which he wished to plant at the mouth of the
Mississippi, and thus carry out the second part.</p>

<p>Having succeeded in France in fitting out this colony,
he sailed with four vessels early in July, 1684, in
search of the Mississippi River by way of the Gulf of
Mexico. With his usual bad fortune, however, he
missed its mouth and landed at Matagorda Bay, 400
miles to the west. Then followed many disasters,
among which were loss of vessels and supplies, lack of
food, sickness and death, and attacks by unfriendly
Indians. For two years the wretched little colony
struggled for life. La Salle was in sore distress. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
knew he had many enemies among his men who would
gladly take his life, but he hoped for help from France.
No help came. It was plain to La Salle that he could
save the suffering colony only by making his way to
Canada. He therefore started out on January 12,
1687, with a party of seventeen men and five horses,
on another long and dangerous journey through the
dense forests&mdash;this time from the Gulf of Mexico to
Canada.</p>

<span class="caption">The Murder of La Salle by his Followers.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Travelling
north, the party crossed the Brazos
River and toiled onward to the Trinity River. But
La Salle's men were tired of travelling through the forests,
and some of them were thirsting for his blood.
They were waiting only for a suitable opportunity to
carry out their murderous purpose. On the morning
of March 19th they lay in ambush, and shot him dead as
he approached, probably not far from the Trinity River.</p>

<p>La Salle's life was one of storm and peril; but he
was as fearless as a lion. Ambitious for himself and
for his country, he had room for little else in his life,
His repeated failures brought criticism and lack of confidence
from men who had loaned him large sums of
money, and these criticisms hardened his spirit. Many
enemies making him suspicious, he seemed to lose
sympathy with his men, and became harsh in his treatment
of them. But he did a great work for France,
a work which entitles him to be regarded as one of the
most remarkable of all the explorers of America.</p>

<p>As a pioneer in leading the way along the Ohio
and the Mississippi, La Salle did much for
France. He hoped to do far more. His cherished
dream was to build up in this vast and fertile territory
an empire for France. But the French King foolishly
feared that planting colonies in America would take
too many of his subjects out of France, and refused to
do that which might have made his new possessions
secure. The opportunity thus neglected was seized
fifty years later by the hardy English settlers who
pushed westward across the Alleghany Mountains.
This movement brought on a struggle between the
two nations, a few events of which are important to
mention.</p>

<p>You will remember that two years after the coming
of John Smith to Jamestown, Champlain sailed up the
St. Lawrence and settled Quebec for the French.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
You will also recall that the French explorers, priests,
and traders had been gradually making their way into
the heart of the continent, by way of the Great Lakes,
until at last La Salle glided down to the mouth of the
Mississippi, and took possession of the land in the
name of the French King. This was in 1681, the
year the Quakers were settling Pennsylvania and fifty-two
years before the settlement of Georgia, the youngest
of the thirteen original colonies.</p>

<p>Just one year before this last settlement there was
born in Westmoreland County, Va., a boy who was
to play a large part in the history not only of the
Ohio and Mississippi valleys, but of the whole country.
This boy was George Washington. He was
born on February 22, 1732, in an old-fashioned Virginia
farm-house, near the Potomac River, on what was
known as Bridge's Creek Plantation. The house had
four rooms on the ground
floor, with an attic of long
sloping roofs and an enormous
brick chimney at
each end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 624px;">
<img src="images/illus132.jpg" width="624" height="480" alt="Washington's Birthplace." title="" />
<span class="caption">Washington's Birthplace.</span>
</div>

<p>George's father was a
wealthy planter, owning
land in four counties,
more than 5,000 acres in
all. Some of his lands were on the banks of the
Rappahannock River, near which he had money invested
in iron-mines. To this plantation the family
removed when George was seven years old, the new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
home being nearly opposite Fredericksburg, then a
small village.</p>

<p>Here he was sent to a small school and taught by a
man named Hobby, a sexton of the church and tenant
of George's father. It was a simple sort of training
the boy received from such a school-master. He
learned a little reading, a little writing, and a little
ciphering, but that was about all. Later in life he
became a fairly good penman, writing a neat round
hand; but he never became a good speller.</p>

<p>When George was eleven years old his father died,
leaving to him the home where they lived on the
Rappahannock, and to his brother Lawrence the great
plantation on the Potomac afterward called Mount
Vernon. Lawrence went to live at Mount Vernon,
while George remained with his mother at the house
opposite Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>Now left without a father, George received his
home training from his mother. Fortunate, indeed,
was he to have such a mother to teach him; for she
was kind, firm, and had a strong practical sense. She
loved her son, and he deeply appreciated her fond care
of him. Some of George's youthful letters to his
mother are full of interest. After the manner of the
time he addressed her formally as "Honored Madam,"
and signed himself "Your dutiful son."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 533px;">

<span class="caption">WASHINGTON CROSSING THE ALLEGHANY RIVER</span>
</div>

<p>Nor was his mother the only strong and wholesome
influence over his home life. His eldest brother,
Lawrence, played an important part in shaping his
character. According to the custom of those days,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>Lawrence, as the eldest son of a Virginia planter, would
inherit the bulk of his father's estate. He was therefore
sent to an excellent school in England, to receive
the training which would fit him to be a gentleman and
a leader in social life. For learning was not held in
such high esteem as ability to look after the business
of a large plantation and take a leading part in the
public life of the county and the colony.</p>

<p>With such a training Lawrence returned from England,
a young man of culture and fine manners and
well fitted to be a man of affairs. From this time on
George, now only seven or eight years old, looked up
to his brother, fourteen years his senior, with cordial
admiration. Lawrence became George's model of manhood,
and returned his younger brother's devotion with
a tender love.</p>

<p>Soon after the death of his father, the boy went to
live with his brother Augustine on the Bridge's Creek
Plantation, in order to have the advantages of a good
school there. Many of his copy-books and books of
exercises, containing such legal forms as receipts, bills
and deeds, as well as pictures of birds and faces, have
been preserved. In these books there are, also, his
rules of conduct, maxims which he kept before him
as aids to good behavior. The following are a few of
them:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 598px;">
<img src="images/illus136.jpg" width="598" height="800" alt="The English Colonies and the French Claims in 1754." title="" />
<span class="caption">The English Colonies and the French Claims in 1754.</span>
</div>

<p>"Every action in company ought to be with some
sign of respect to those present.</p>

<p>"When a man does all he can, though it succeeds
not well, blame not him that did it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Undertake not what you cannot perform, but be
careful to keep your promise.</p>

<p>"Speak not evil of the absent: for it is unjust.</p>

<p>"Labor to keep alive in your breast that little spark
of celestial fire
called conscience."</p>

<p>In George's
school-days he
heard many
stories about
wars with the
Indians and
about troubles
between the
English and the
French colonies.
Moreover,
his brother
Lawrence
had been a soldier
in the West
Indies in a war
between England
and Spain,
from which he had returned full of enthusiasm about
what he had felt and seen. It was at this time that
Lawrence changed the name of his plantation on the
Potomac to Mount Vernon, in honor of Admiral Vernon,
under whose command he had fought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Catching his brother's military spirit, George organized
his boy friends into little military companies,
and, as their commander, drilled them, paraded them,
and led them in their sham battles in the school-yard.</p>

<p>Naturally the boys looked to him as leader, for he
was strong in mind and body, and fond of athletic
sports. It is said that no boy of his age was his match
in running, leaping, wrestling, and pitching quoits.
His athletic skill expressed itself also in his fearless
horsemanship. The story is told that he once
mounted a colt that had successfully resisted all attempts
to remain on his back. But George held on
until the spirited animal, in a frenzy of effort to throw
off the persistent young rider, reared, broke a blood-vessel,
and fell dead. His keen enjoyment of a
spirited horse, and of hunting in the freedom of woods
and fields for such game as foxes, deer, and wild-cats,
lasted to a late period of his life.</p>

<p>George's good qualities were not confined to out-door
sports requiring skill and physical strength alone.
He was a manly boy, stout-hearted and truthful. All
the boys trusted him because they knew he was fair-minded,
and often called upon him to settle their disputes.</p>

<p>But we must not think of him as a perfect boy, finding
it easy always to do the right thing. George
Washington had his faults, as some of the rest of us
have. For instance, he had a quick temper which he
found it hard to control. In fact, he found this a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
harder thing to do than many brave deeds for which
he became famous in his manhood.</p>

<p>The humdrum quiet of a Virginia plantation did not
satisfy this alert boy longing for a life of action.
He had heard from
Lawrence about life on
a war-vessel, and had
also seen, year after
year, the annual return
to the plantation wharf
of the vessel that carried
a cargo of tobacco
to England and brought
back in exchange such
goods as the planter
needed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus138.jpg" width="600" height="632" alt="The French in the Ohio Valley." title="" />
<span class="caption">The French in the Ohio Valley.</span>
</div>

<p>Eager for a change
of surroundings, he made all his plans to go to sea.
The chest containing his clothing had been packed
and sent down to the wharf, but at the last moment
he yielded to his mother's persuasion, and gave up his
cherished plan of becoming a sailor-boy. He was then
fourteen years old.</p>

<p>Returning to school, George continued to be careful
and exact in all his work, his motto being "Whatever
is worth doing at all is worth doing well." He was
also methodical, and herein lay one of the secrets of
his ability to accomplish so much when he came to
manhood.</p>

<p>His love of out-door sport gave him a natural bent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
for surveying, to the study of which he applied himself
diligently. He soon became proficient enough to
command confidence in his ability as a trustworthy
surveyor.</p>

<p>In the autumn of his sixteenth year he went to
live with his brother Lawrence on the Mount Vernon
plantation, where he spent much of his time in surveying.
Here he met a man who exerted a large
influence on his later life. This man was Lord Fairfax,
a tall, courtly, white-haired English gentleman of
about sixty years of age, who was living at Belvoir, a
large plantation a few miles from Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>At this time George was a shy, awkward youth,
somewhat overgrown for his age, with long arms, and
a tall, large frame. But in his serious face there was a
sign of quiet self-control and firm purpose.</p>

<p>The provincial youth of fifteen and the cultured
English lord of sixty, though so far apart in age and
experience, soon became close friends. They were
much together. Sometimes they would spend the
morning in surveying, and start out in the afternoon
on their horses for a gay time in fox-hunting. They
doubtless talked freely to each other, and as Lord
Fairfax had seen much of the best English life and
had read some of the best English books, he was an
interesting companion to his earnest and thoughtful
young friend.</p>

<p>This warm friendship soon had a practical turn.
Lord Fairfax owned an immense tract of country in
the Shenandoah Valley&mdash;by some said to be as much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
as one-fifth of the present State of Virginia. Wishing
to learn more about it and observing George to be
exceedingly careful and accurate in his surveying, he
decided to send him over the Blue Ridge into the wild
region to find out and report to him something about
the lands there.</p>

<p>He was to have only one companion, George William
Fairfax, who was the eldest son of Lord Fairfax's
cousin, and was then about twenty-two years old.
About the middle of March, 1748, when George
Washington was barely sixteen years old, these two
young fellows started out together on horseback, to
travel through the forest a distance of 100 miles
before they reached the Shenandoah Valley. They
carried guns in their hands, for until their return
about a month later they would have to depend
mainly upon hunting for their supply of food. The
account which George himself has left enables us
to picture them riding alone through the forest with
no road except perhaps, at times, a path made by
Indians or wild animals.</p>

<p>After reaching the wild country they had to live in
the most primitive fashion. For instance, Washington
tells of a night in a woodman's cabin when he had
nothing but a mat of straw for his bed, with but a
single blanket for cover, and that alive with vermin.
He wrote in his diary: "I made a promise to sleep so
no more, choosing rather to sleep in the open air before
the fire."</p>

<p>Again, in a letter to a friend, he says: "I have not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
slept above three or four nights in a bed, but, after
walking a good deal all day, I have lain down before
the fire upon a little hay, straw, fodder, or a bear-skin,
with man, wife and children, like dogs and cats; and
happy is he who gets the berth nearest the fire."</p>

<p>Sometimes they tried life in a tent. Once in a
storm the tent was blown over, and at another time
the smoke from the fire drove the occupants out of
doors. One night, according to the same diary, "we
camped in the woods, and after we had pitched our
tent, and made a large fire, we pulled out our knapsacks
to recruit ourselves. Every one was his own
cook. Our spits were forked sticks; our plates were
large chips." As for bread, most of the time, if not
all, they had none, and they drank only pure water
from running streams.</p>

<p>On another occasion they fell in with a war-party
of painted warriors whom Washington and his friend
Fairfax fearlessly joined, all gathering about a huge
fire built under the trees. As the great logs blazed
in the midst of the dark forest, the Indians joined in
one of their wild, weird dances. They leaped to and
fro, whooped and shrieked like mad beings, while
one of their companions thumped upon a drum made
by drawing a deer-skin across a pot filled with water,
and another rattled a gourd containing shot and decorated
with a horse's tail, "to make it look fine."</p>

<p>It was a strange experience which these two youths
had that month. But Washington was well paid, earning
from $7 to $21 a day. On the return of the young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
surveyor to Mount Vernon his employer, Lord Fairfax,
was so much pleased with the report that he
secured his appointment as public surveyor. For the
next three years George lived the life of a surveyor,
spending much of his time with Lord Fairfax at his
wilderness home, Greenway Court, not far from Winchester.</p>

<p>During this time George was gaining valuable knowledge
of the forest, and becoming so intimate with Indian
life that, as people said, he came to walk like an
Indian. His life in the woods developed fearlessness,
patience, and self-reliance, qualities which, joined to
his ability and character, inspired men's confidence and
established his leadership. Governor Dinwiddie, of
Virginia, appointed him an officer in the State militia,
with the rank of major. And as an officer, his influence
continued to increase.</p>

<p>Some two years afterward his brother Lawrence died
and left the Mount Vernon estate to his daughter, with
George Washington as guardian. On her death, a little
later, Washington became owner of the immense plantation
at Mount Vernon, and hence a wealthy man.</p>

<p>Fortune had favored him, and he might have chosen
to enter upon a life of ease, but events soon occurred
which called into action all his heroic qualities. The
strife between the English and the French for control
in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys was advancing
rapidly toward war.</p>

<p>The French had long considered this territory their
own. We recall that La Salle had explored it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
attempted to plant colonies here. For many years,
French explorers, priests, and traders had toiled on,
patiently pushing their way through the forests, and
planting stronghold after stronghold. At length, pressing
closer on the English border, they began to build
forts between Lake Erie and the head of the Ohio.
For the English also had their eyes on the fertile
valley of the Ohio, and were beginning to occupy it.</p>

<p>At once a company composed largely of Virginia
planters was organized for the purpose of making settlements
in the Ohio Valley. Before they could do
much, however, the French had boldly advanced far
into territory claimed by England.</p>

<p>The people of Virginia in alarm, said, "This advance
must stop. What can be the plans of the
French? How many are already in the forts lying
between Lake Erie and the Ohio River?" Governor
Dinwiddie and other Virginia gentlemen grew excited
as they asked such questions. They decided, therefore,
to send out to the French commander in the fort
near Lake Erie, a trusty messenger who should ask by
what right the French were invading a country belonging
to England. This messenger was also to find out
what he could about the forces of the French in that
vicinity, and about their plans. Moreover, he was to
make a strong effort to win over to the English the
Indians, whose friendship the French were trying to
gain. As a suitable man for this dangerous enterprise,
all eyes turned to George Washington, still only
twenty-one years of age.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>The journey of 1,000 miles through trackless forests,
in the bitter cold of Winter, did not offer a cheerful
outlook. But on October 30, 1753, with seven
companions, including an Indian and a French interpreter,
George Washington started from Williamsburg.
Stopping at Fredericksburg to bid good-by to his
mother, he went on by way of Alexandria to Winchester,
the familiar spot where he had spent many happy
days with Lord Fairfax. Here he got horses and various
supplies needed for his journey.</p>

<p>From Winchester the little band of men moved forward
to Will's Creek (now Cumberland, Md.), and
then plunged boldly into the forest. From that time
on, the difficulties of the journey were wellnigh overwhelming;
but by perseverance in climbing lofty mountains
and in swimming rivers swollen by heavy rains,
the end of their journey was at last reached.</p>

<p>On receiving an answer from the French commander,
who promised nothing, Washington started
back home. The horses soon proved too weak to
make much headway through the dense forests and
deep snow, and it seemed best to push on without
them. He also left behind him all of his party except
a trusty woodsman. Then putting on an Indian costume
with a heavy cloak drawn over it, he strapped
upon his back the pack containing his papers and, gun
in hand, started off. A little later they were joined
by an Indian guide, who soon gave evidence of his
treachery by suddenly turning and discharging his gun
at Washington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Washington had another narrow escape from death.
He had expected on reaching the Alleghany River to
cross on the ice, but to his dismay he found the ice
broken up and the stream filled with whirling blocks.
There was no way of getting over except on a raft
which he and his companion had to make with a single
hatchet. Having at last finished it, they pushed off,
and then began a desperate struggle with the current
and, great blocks of floating ice. Washington, in trying
to guide the raft with a pole, was thrown violently
into the water. By catching hold of one of the raft
logs he recovered himself, and by heroic effort succeeded
in reaching an island nearby. Here the travellers
suffered through a night of intense cold, not daring
to kindle a fire for fear of the Indians.</p>

<p>On January 16th they reached Williamsburg, where
Washington delivered to Governor Dinwiddie the unsatisfactory
letter he had brought from the French
commander. Although the result of the expedition was
not what the Virginians had hoped for, Washington
had so well succeeded in carrying out his perilous mission
that he was highly praised for his effort.</p>

<p>The defiant answer of the French commander made
it seem probable to the people of Virginia that war
would follow. Therefore a company of men was
sent out to build a fort at the place where the Alleghany
and Monongahela rivers unite to form the
Ohio. Washington's quick eye had noted the importance
of this site, afterward known as the "Gateway
of the West."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime Washington was drilling men for
service, and in April he set out with the rank of lieutenant-colonel
with two companies for the frontier.
He had not gone very far when he learned that the
French had driven off with a large force the men who
had been sent to the head of the Ohio to build a fort;
but he continued his march. When a little later the
approach of a small body of French was reported, the
Virginians surprised them, killing, wounding, or capturing
all but one. Colonel Washington was in the
thickest of the fight, and wrote in a letter, "I heard
the bullets whistle and, believe me, there is something
charming in the sound."</p>

<p>After this fight, which began the war, Washington
returned to Great Meadows, and, learning that a large
body of French were marching against him, hastily
threw up rough earthworks, which he called Fort
Necessity. When attacked soon after by two or three
times his own number, the brave young colonel did
not shrink. For nine hours, in a heavy downpour of
rain, he and his sturdy followers stood up to their
knees in mud and water in the trenches. Being so
greatly outnumbered, his troops were of course defeated,
but the House of Burgesses gave their commander
a vote of thanks in recognition of his bravery.</p>

<p>The war now began in bitter earnest, and England
promptly sent over troops, with General Braddock in
command. When on reaching Virginia he heard of
Colonel Washington, Braddock appointed him a member
of his staff. Colonel Washington soon discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
that General Braddock was not the man to handle an
army in woodland warfare. He would gladly have advised
him, but the haughty British general would hear
no suggestions from a colonial officer.</p>

<p>With 2,000 soldiers, General Braddock marched
against the French, stationed at Fort Duquesne at the
head of the Ohio. On the morning of July 9th, when
the army was only eight miles from the fort, it was
suddenly attacked by the French and Indians, who
lay in ambush in the thick forest. The English soldiers,
standing in solid masses, were shot down by
squads, but the Virginians fought from behind trees in
true Indian fashion.</p>

<p>Braddock, who has been rightly called a gallant
bull-dog, rode madly to and fro, giving orders to his
men, but in vain. He shortly fell from his horse, with
a mortal wound. The manly figure of Colonel Washington
was a conspicuous mark for the enemy's guns.
Two horses fell under him; four bullets tore through
his clothing; but he escaped injury.</p>

<p>The result was a sore defeat for the English army.
It lost 700 men out of 2,000, and three-fourths of its
officers. Nothing but retreat could be thought of.
The brave but narrow-minded Braddock had made an
enormous and expensive blunder.</p>

<p>After Braddock's defeat Washington was given command
of the Virginia troops. Later in the war he led
an expedition against Fort Duquesne, as Braddock had
done. But on hearing of his approach the French
fled. The war having subsided in the Ohio Valley,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Washington resigned his commission, returned to Mount
Vernon, and soon afterward married Mrs. Martha
Custis, a rich young widow.</p>

<p>We have seen him first as a robust lad, then as a
fearless woodsman, and later as a brave soldier. We
will leave him for a while at Mount Vernon, where in
the refined society of old Virginia he came to be
equally well known as a high-bred gentleman.</p>

<p>We have just seen how the English and the
French struggled to get control of the Ohio
Valley. But the fighting in the Last French War was
not confined to this region. Many of the battles
were fought to secure control of two waterways. One
of these was the route to Canada, including Lakes
George and Champlain, and the other was the St. Lawrence
River. Indeed, the crowning feature of the Last
French War was the heroic effort made by a young
English general to capture Quebec.</p>

<p>This young general was James Wolfe. He was
born in the southeastern part of England in 1727.
From his father, who was an officer in the English
army, he inherited a love for the soldier's life. But in
all the trials and dangers to which he was exposed in
his short and stormy career, he continued to be a devoted
son, his love for his mother being especially ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>der
and sincere. With her he kept up a regular correspondence,
in which he freely expressed his inmost
thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>When only sixteen years of age he was sent to
Flanders as an adjutant in a regiment of the English
army. Here, by faithful and thorough work, he won
promotion and soon, through bravery and skill, received
an appointment as brigadier-general. At the
age of thirty-two he was sent to America to assist in
an expedition to Louisburg, and played a large part in
the capture of that stronghold.</p>

<p>He presented an awkward figure. At that time he
was tall and slender, with long limbs, narrow shoulders,
and red hair tied in a queue behind. His face
was plain, with receding chin and forehead, and up-turned
nose. But his keen, bright eyes, full of energy
and fearlessness, gave him an attractive countenance
and revealed a heroic nature.</p>

<p>His health was never robust. As a child he was
delicate, and as a youth he had frequent attacks of
illness. But his resolute will and his high ideals enabled
him to do what others of a different mould would
never have attempted. He was governed, too, by an
overmastering sense of duty, which was his most striking
trait.</p>

<span class="caption">Quebec and Surroundings.</span>
</div>

<p>Although at times extremely impatient, his tenderness
and frankness of nature easily won enduring friendships.
His soldiers loved him so dearly that they
were willing to follow him through any dangers to victory
or death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>After the capture of Louisburg, Wolfe was so worn
by the demands upon his strength that he returned to
England and went to Bath for treatment. At this time
he met Miss Katherine Lowther,
to whom he soon became
engaged.</p>

<p>But he was not long to remain
inactive, for his country
needed him. The great William
Pitt, who had now become
the head of affairs in
England, saw in this fearless
young general a fitting leader for a dangerous and difficult
enterprise. This was an expedition against Quebec,
the strongest and most important position held
by the French in America.</p>

<p>The French army at Quebec, commanded by General
Montcalm, numbered more than 16,000 men, consisting
of Frenchmen, Canadians, and Indians. But some
were boys of fifteen, and others old men of eighty.
Here they awaited Wolfe, whose army numbered 9,000.</p>

<p>By June 21, 1759, Wolfe's fleet lay at anchor in the
north channel of the island of Orleans, not far below
Quebec. Then began a time of trial and discouragement
to the young commander, who vainly looked for
a point from which he might hope to make a successful
attack.</p>

<p>In the meantime his soldiers were suffering from
intense heat and drenching rains. Much sickness was
the natural result. Wolfe, anxious with doubt, him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>self
fell a victim to a burning fever. But he would
not give up. He said to his physician, "I know perfectly
well you cannot cure me. But pray make me
up so that I can be without pain for a few days, and
able to do my duty. That is all I want." Although
racked with pain, he went from tent to tent among his
men, trying to encourage them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus154.jpg" width="336" height="361" alt="General Montcalm." title="" />
<span class="caption">General Montcalm.</span>
</div>

<p>During several weeks there was fighting now and
then in the neighborhood of Quebec. On July 31st
Wolfe's troops made a determined
attack upon the French on the
heights just north of the Montmorency
River. The English advanced,
in the face of a heavy,
blinding rain, with great heroism,
but were forced to retire without
having gained a foothold.</p>

<p>Thus the summer wore on near
to its close. In desperation, Wolfe decided upon a
bold move. He determined to sail up the river,
land above Quebec, scale the steep and rugged cliffs
there, and compel the French to fight a battle or surrender
the city.</p>

<p>The most serious difficulty was to find a way to
scale the cliffs. At last one day came a glimmer of
hope. For looking through a telescope from the
south side of the river, the resolute young commander
discovered a narrow path leading up the frowning
heights not far from the town. "Here," he quickly
decided, "I will land my men."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>Promptly, eagerly, he began to lay his plans. On
the morning of September 7th, in order to conceal from
Montcalm their real purpose, the British, in gay red
uniforms, embarked and sailed up and down the St.
Lawrence, as if looking for a landing-place. On September
12th, the fatal time set for decisive action,
some of the English vessels, with a large body of troops
on board, hovered about the shore below Quebec, as
if to force a landing there. Montcalm was completely
deceived. The ruse had succeeded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main body of English troops, which
was to make ready a landing, was quietly anchored in
the river above Quebec. Twenty-four brave men volunteered
as leaders to scale the cliffs. These men took
their places in the foremost boat.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the morning Wolfe gave the order
to advance. It was a starlit night, but as there was no
moon, it was dark enough to conceal the movements of
the English. For two hours the long procession of
boats filled with soldiers floated silently down the river.
The brave young Wolfe, calm and masterful, was in
one of the foremost boats. Fully expecting to be killed
in the coming battle, he had, earlier in the evening,
given to an old school-friend the portrait of his betrothed,
Miss Lowther, which he had long worn about
his neck. He said to his friend, "Give this to Miss
Lowther, if I am killed."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 528px;">
<img src="images/illus156.jpg" width="528" height="800" alt="THE DEATH OF WOLFE." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE DEATH OF WOLFE.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>We can imagine the strain upon Wolfe's feelings
during the two hours in which the boats floated downstream.
Perhaps it was to relieve this strain that he
repeated in a quiet voice Gray's "Elegy in a Country
Churchyard." He seemed to dwell with peculiar feeling
upon the last line in the following stanza:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,</span><br />
Await alike the inevitable hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The paths of glory lead but to the grave.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>On coming to the end of the poem, he said, "Gentlemen,
I would rather have written those lines than take
Quebec."</p>

<p>When they had almost reached their landing-place
they heard a sudden call from a French sentry, "<i>Qui
vive!</i>" "<i>France</i>," replied one of Wolfe's officers,
who spoke French. "<i>A quel r&eacute;giment?</i>" "<i>De la
Reine</i>," was the reply, and thinking the boats were
under the control of Frenchmen carrying provisions to
Montcalm, the sentry let them pass. Later when challenged
by another sentry, the same English officer said
in French: "Provision-boats. Don't make a noise&mdash;the
English will hear us."</p>

<p>At length they came to the spot since called Wolfe's
Cove, and there landed. The twenty-four volunteers
clambered up the path in the darkness and, reaching
the top, surprised the small number of Frenchmen
stationed there, and quickly overpowered them. It was
with much difficulty that Wolfe's army succeeded, by
seizing hold of trees and bushes, in getting to the top
with muskets, cannons, and supplies.</p>

<p>At daybreak, Wolfe chose as the field of battle the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Plains of Abraham, a high stretch of land extending
along the river just above the town.</p>

<p>The brave Montcalm, in doubt and perplexity, had
spent a sleepless night pacing to and fro. When told
of the landing of the English troops he rode up from
his camp to see what was going on. Amazed at the
"silent wall of red" presented by the English army
drawn up in battle array, he said, "This is a serious
business."</p>

<p>Wolfe, anxious but calm, rode to and fro, inspiring
his soldiers with confidence. "Victory or death" was
their watchword, for in case of failure retreat was
impossible.</p>

<p>By ten o'clock the French were in line of battle,
ready for the onset. With loud shouts, they rushed
upon the English. But the latter, waiting quietly until
the enemy was only forty paces away, met them with
a withering fire that strewed the ground with dead and
dying men. While the French were wavering, the
English fired another deadly volley, and then with
victorious shouts rushed headlong upon the confused
ranks.</p>

<p>The fighting was stubborn and furious, and Wolfe
was in the thickest of the fray. While he was leading a
charge, a bullet tore through his wrist. Quickly wrapping
his handkerchief about the wound, he dashed forward
until he was for the third time struck by a bullet,
this time receiving a mortal wound. Four of his men
bore him in their arms to the rear, and wished to send
for a surgeon; but Wolfe said, "There's no need; it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
all over with me." A little later, hearing someone cry
"They run; see how they run!" he asked, "Who
runs?" "The enemy, sir. Egad, they give way
everywhere!" Then said Wolfe in his last moments,
"Now, God be praised. I will die in peace."</p>

<p>Montcalm, too, died like a hero. Shot through the
body, he was supported on either side as he passed
through the town; but when he heard cries of distress
and pity from his friends and followers, he said, "It's
nothing, it's nothing; don't be troubled for me, good
friends." Being told that he could not live many
hours, he exclaimed, "Thank God, I shall not live to
see Quebec surrendered." A few days later Quebec
came into the hands of the English. Its fall meant the
loss to France of all her possessions in North America
except two small islands for fishing-stations in the Gulf
of St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The treaty of peace at the end of the war, called the
Last French War,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> was signed at Paris in 1763. By this
treaty France ceded to Spain all the territory between
the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains; also
the town of New Orleans, controlling the navigation
of the Mississippi. To England she gave Canada and
all the territory east of the Mississippi. Thus by a
single final blow did Wolfe so weaken the hold of the
French upon North America, as to compel them to
give up practically all they had there.</p>

<p>With the fall of Quebec, France lost her hold
of nearly all the territory in North America
that she had acquired through the energy and heroism
of her explorers. England profited by this loss, but
England herself had soon to meet with a misfortune
far heavier&mdash;the loss of all her colonies east of the
Alleghanies and along the Atlantic coast. Very soon
after the close of the Last French War, she began, under
the lead of the dull-witted King George, to treat them
with so much injustice and oppression that in self-defence
they were driven to take up arms for the security
of their rights as a free-born people. The result
was the American Revolution, which began in 1775
and ended in 1783. How this Revolution came to
be, is one of the most interesting chapters in our history.
Let us now trace the course of events leading
to its outbreak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>After the close of the Last French War, England
was heavily in debt. As this debt had been incurred
largely in defence of the English colonies in America,
George III., King of England, believed that the colonies
should help to carry the burden. Moreover, as
he intended to send them a standing army for their
protection, he deemed it wise to levy upon them a tax
for its support.</p>

<p>Parliament, therefore, which was composed largely
of the King's friends, ready to do his bidding, passed
a law called the Stamp Act. This required the colonists
to use stamps upon their newspapers and upon
legal documents, the price of stamps ranging from a
half-penny to twelve pounds. The King thought this
tax would be just because it would fall upon all the
colonists alike.</p>

<p>But the colonists were of a different mind; for England
had not fought the Last French War so much
to defend them as to protect her own trade. Besides,
they had already paid a reasonable share of the war
expenses, and had furnished a fair proportion of
soldiers for battle. They had always given their share
toward the expenses of their defence, and were still
willing to do so. If the King would ask them for a
definite sum, they would raise it through their Colonial
Assemblies. But they strongly objected to any
English tax.</p>

<p>These Colonial Assemblies were composed of men
who represented the colonists and made laws for the
colonists. Therefore the colonists were willing to pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
any taxes levied by the Assemblies. As free-born
Englishmen they objected to paying taxes levied by
Parliament, which did not represent them. Parliament
might levy taxes upon the people of England, whom
it did represent. But only the Colonial Assemblies
could tax the colonists, because they alone represented
the colonists. In other words, as James Otis in a stirring
speech had declared, there must be "No taxation
without representation."</p>

<p>George III. could not understand the feelings of the
colonists, and he had no sympathy with their views.
His mother had said to him when he was crowned,
"George, be King," and this advice had pleased him.
For he was wilful, and desired to have his own way as
a ruler. Thus far he had shown little respect for the
British Parliament, and he felt even less for Colonial
Assemblies. Certainly if he was to rule in his own
way in England, he must compel the obedience of the
stubborn colonists in America. The standing army
which the King wished to send to America was
designed not so much to protect the colonies as to
enforce the will of the King, and this the colonists
knew. They therefore opposed with bitter indignation
the payment of taxes levied for the army's support.</p>

<p>Patrick Henry was one of many who were willing
to risk everything in their earnest struggle against the
tyrannical schemes of King George. Patrick Henry
was born in 1736 in Hanover County, Va. His
father was a lawyer of much intelligence, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
mother belonged to a fine old Welsh family. As a
boy, Patrick's advantages at school were meagre, and
even these he did not appreciate. Books were far
less attractive to him than his gun and fishing-rod.
With these he delighted to wander
through the woods searching for
game, or to sit on the bank of some
stream fishing by the hour. When
out-door sports failed, he found delight
at home in his violin.</p>

<p>When he was fifteen years old, his
father put him into a country store,
where he remained a year. He then
began business for himself, but he
gave so little attention to it that he soon failed. He
next tried farming, and afterward storekeeping again,
but without success.</p>

<p>At length he decided to practise law, and after six
months' study applied for admission to the bar.
Although he had much difficulty in passing the examination,
he had at last found a vocation which suited
him. He did well in his law practice; but we must
pass over this part of his life in order that we may
go with him to Williamsburg. He went there in 1765,
soon after the passage of the Stamp Act by the English
Parliament, to attend the session of the Virginia House
of Burgesses, of which he had been elected a member.</p>

<p>We get a vivid picture of our hero at this period of
his career as he rides on horseback toward Williamsburg,
carrying his papers in his saddle-bags. John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
Esten Cooke says of him: "He was at this time just
twenty-nine, tall in figure, but stooping, with a grim
expression, small blue eyes which had a peculiar twinkle,
and wore a brown wig without powder, a 'peach-blossom
coat,' leather knee-breeches, and yarn stockings."</p>

<p>There was great excitement in Williamsburg, and it
was a time of grave doubt. What should be done
about the Stamp Act? Should the people of Virginia
tamely submit to it and say nothing? Should they urge
Parliament to repeal it? or should they cry out against
it in open defiance?</p>

<p>Most of the members were wealthy planters, men of
dignity and influence. These men spoke of England
as the "Mother" of the colonies, and were so loyal in
their attachment that the idea of war was hateful to
them. Certainly, the thought of separation from England
they could not entertain for a moment.</p>

<p>But Patrick Henry was eager for prompt and decisive
action. Having hastily written, on a blank leaf
taken from a law-book, a series of resolutions, he rose
and offered them to the assembly. One of these resolutions
declared that the General Assembly of the
colony had the sole right and power of laying taxes in
the colony.</p>

<p>A hot debate followed, in the course of which
Patrick Henry, ablaze with indignation, arose and addressed
the body. His speech closed with these
thrilling words: "C&aelig;sar had his Brutus, Charles the
First his Cromwell, and George the Third&mdash;" "Treason!
Treason!" shouted voices from the stormy as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>sembly.
Pausing a moment in a fearless attitude, the
young orator calmly added, "may profit from their example.
If this be treason make the most of it." The
resolutions were passed.</p>

<p>It was a great triumph for the young orator, who
now became the "idol of the people." As he was
going out of the door at the close of the session, one
of the plain people gave him a slap on the shoulder,
saying, "Stick to us, old fellow, or we are gone!"</p>

<p>The note of defiance sounded by Patrick Henry at
this time vibrated throughout America, and encouraged
the colonists to unite against the oppressive taxation
imposed upon them through the influence of the
stubborn and misguided King George.</p>

<p>But the English people as a whole did not support
the King. Many of them, among whom were some
of England's wisest statesmen, believed he was making
a great mistake in trying to tax the Americans without
their consent. Said William Pitt, in a stirring speech
in the House of Commons: "Sir, I rejoice that America
has resisted. Three millions<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of people so dead to
all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to submit to be
slaves, would have been fit instruments to make slaves
of all the rest."</p>

<p>In the ten years following the passage of the Stamp
Act, events in America moved rapidly. Some of these
we shall learn more about a little later. It is sufficient
here to say that the colonial merchants refused to import
goods so long as the Stamp Act was in effect;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>that their action caused the merchants, manufacturers,
and ship-owners in England to lose money heavily;
that these merchants and ship-owners at once begged
Parliament to repeal the Stamp Act; and that Parliament
did repeal it
one year after its
passage.</p>

<span class="caption">St. John's Church, Richmond.</span>
</div>

<p>Ten years after
Patrick Henry's
eloquent speech
at Williamsburg
against the Stamp
Act, the people
of Virginia were
again deeply aroused; for King George, acting through
Parliament, had sent 3,000 soldiers to Boston to force
her unruly people and those of Massachusetts to obey
certain of his commands. Virginia having given her
hearty support to the people of Massachusetts, the
royal Governor of Virginia drove the Colonial Assembly
away from Williamsburg. But the people of Virginia,
resolute in defence of their rights, elected a convention
of their leading men, who met at old St. John's Church
in Richmond, a church which is yet standing. Excitement
was widespread, and thoughtful men grew serious
at the war-cloud growing blacker every hour.</p>

<p>Virginians had already begun to make preparations
to fight if they must. But many still hoped that the
disagreements between the Americans and King George
might be settled, and therefore believed that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
should act with great caution. Patrick Henry thought
differently. He was persuaded that the time had come
when talk should give place to prompt, energetic, decisive
action. The war was at hand. It could not
be avoided. The Americans must fight, or tamely
submit to be slaves.</p>

<p>Believing these things with all the intensity of his
nature, he offered a resolution that Virginia should at
once prepare to defend herself. Many of the leading
men stoutly opposed this resolution as rash and unwise.</p>

<p>At length Patrick Henry arose, his face pale and
his voice trembling with deep emotion. Soon his
stooping figure became erect. His eyes flashed fire.
His voice rang out like a trumpet. As he continued,
men leaned forward in breathless interest, thrilled by
his magical words:</p>

<p>"We must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight!
An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts is all that
is left us! They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable
to cope with so formidable an adversary. But
when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week,
or the next year? Will it be when we are totally
disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed
in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution
and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of
effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and
hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies
shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are
not weak, if we make a proper use of the means which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the God of nature hath placed in our power.... There
is no retreat, but in submission and slavery!
Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard
on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable&mdash;and
let it come! I repeat it, sir, let it come!</p>

<p>"It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen
may cry peace, peace&mdash;but there is no peace.
The war is actually begun! The next gale that
sweeps from the North will bring to our ears the clash
of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the
field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that
gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so
dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take; but
as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!"</p>

<p>This wonderful speech made a deep impression not
only in Virginia but throughout the colonies. The
next month the war began at Lexington and Concord.
A little later Patrick Henry was made commander-in-chief
of the Virginia forces, and later still was elected
Governor of Virginia.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty-eight he retired to an estate in
Charlotte County, called "Red Hill," where he lived a
simple and beautiful life. He died in 1799. His influence
in arousing the people of Virginia and of the other
colonies to a sense of their rights as freemen cannot easily
be measured. Without doubt his impassioned oratory
played a most important part in shaping the course
of events which resulted in the Revolutionary War.</p>

<p>We have just seen how the people of Virginia,
under the leadership of Patrick Henry, arose
against King George's pet measure, the Stamp Act.
But the Virginians were not alone in the feeling of
opposition to the English King. Just as brave and
liberty-loving were the Massachusetts people, with
Samuel Adams as their leader.</p>

<p>He was born in Boston in 1722. His father was a
well-to-do man, who filled a large place in the community.
Of Samuel Adams's boyhood we know little,
but as far as we can learn he was a studious, in-door
sort of lad, with little fondness for sport of any kind.
His father wished him to be a clergyman, but he preferred
to study law. Since, however, his mother did
not approve, he gave that up for a business life,
eventually joining his father in the malt business.</p>

<p>When the excitement over the Stamp Act began,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Samuel Adams was forty-two years old. He was of
medium size, with gray hair and keen gray eyes.
Although his hands were tremulous, as if with age, his
health was vigorous. Like Patrick Henry, he had
but little aptitude for business. So we need not be
surprised to learn that in time he lost about all the
property his father had left him.</p>

<p>In fact, Samuel Adams soon gave up all kinds of
private business, devoting his time and strength to
public life. As a result he and his family had to live
on the very small salary which he received as clerk of
the Assembly of Massachusetts. Poor as he was, however,
no man could be more upright. The British tried
to buy him, but found him the very soul of honor.
In what way he gave expression to his interest in the
public welfare can be briefly told.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, King George, much
against his will, had to submit to the repeal of the
Stamp Act by Parliament. But he was not satisfied.
He could never carry out his selfish scheme of personal
government in England and in America if he
allowed the stubborn colonists to have their way in
this matter.</p>

<p>In 1767, therefore, through his tool, Townshend,
Parliament levied new port duties on a few articles,
including glass, lead, paper, and tea. These new taxes
were hateful to the colonists because they were levied
by Parliament, and because the money thus raised was
to be used to their disadvantage in various ways: For
example, some of it was to pay for maintaining in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
America a small English army. This army, the colonists
believed, the King would use to compel them to
do as he willed.</p>

<p>The opposition to the new taxes was just as bitter
as it had been against the Stamp Act. Samuel Adams
felt that only slaves would submit to such high-handed
oppression. He urged the people of Boston and
Massachusetts to join in refusing to import any goods
from England as long as the new taxes were imposed
by Parliament. They did so agree, and thus inflicted
great injury upon English merchants, as they had
done two or three years before.</p>

<p>Of course these merchants suffered heavy losses,
and again begged for a repeal. But the dull-witted
King could not understand the Americans. Thus far
he had not been able to coerce them; he now made a
shrewd attempt to outwit them.</p>

<p>Influenced by him, Parliament took off all the new
taxes except the one on tea. "There must be one
tax to keep the right to tax," he said. If he could
only succeed in getting the Americans to submit to
paying any tax&mdash;no matter how small&mdash;that Parliament
might levy, he would carry his point. He
therefore urged not only the removal of all taxes
except the one on tea, but also made arrangements
whereby Americans could buy their taxed tea cheaper
than it could be bought in England and cheaper even
than they could smuggle it from Holland, as they had
been doing. No doubt the King had great faith in
this foolish scheme. "Of course," he argued, "the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Americans will buy their tea where they can buy it
cheapest, and then we will have them in a trap."
But this was a huge blunder, as we shall now see.</p>

<p>The East India Company arranged to ship cargoes
of tea to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston.
When the tea arrived, the people in New York
and Philadelphia refused to let it land, and in Charleston
they stored it in damp cellars, where it spoiled.
But in Boston, where the Tory Governor, Hutchinson,
was determined to fight a hard battle for the King,
there was a most exciting time. The result was the
famous "Boston Tea Party."</p>

<p>It was a quiet Sunday morning, on the 28th of
November, 1773, when the Darmouth, one of the
three tea-ships on the way to Boston, sailed into the
harbor.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The people were attending service in the
various churches. "The Darmouth is in!" spread
like wildfire, and soon the streets were astir with people,
Sunday though it was, in old Puritan Boston.</p>

<p>Fearing that the tea might be landed, the committee
of correspondence quickly got together and secured a
promise from Benjamin Rotch, the owner of the Darmouth,
that the tea should not be landed before Tuesday.
On Monday morning an immense town meeting
was held in Faneuil Hall, the "Cradle of Liberty."
Five thousand men were present. But Faneuil Hall
proving too small, the crowd had to make its way to
the Old South Church. In addressing the meeting
Samuel Adams asked, "Is it the firm resolution of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>this body that the tea shall not only he sent back,
but that no duty shall be paid thereon?" With a
great shout the men answered "Yes."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/illus175.jpg" width="480" height="590" alt="Faneuil Hall, Boston." title="" />
<span class="caption">Faneuil Hall, Boston.</span>
</div>

<p>Samuel Adams and the people of Boston and the
surrounding towns were
determined that the tea
should not be landed.
Governor Hutchinson
was equally determined
that it should be. The
advantage was with the
Governor, for according
to law the vessels could
not return to England
with the tea unless they
got a clearance from the
collector of customs or
a pass from himself.</p>


<p>But neither the collector
of customs nor Governor Hutchinson would
yield an inch. For nineteen days the struggle continued,
growing daily more bitter. With a stubborn
purpose to prevent the landing of the tea even if they
had to fight, the Boston people appointed men, armed
with muskets and bayonets, some to watch the tea-ships
by day and some by night. Six couriers were
to be ready to mount their horses, which they kept
saddled and bridled, and speed into the country to
give the alarm to the people. Sentinels were stationed
in the church-belfries to ring the bells, and beacon-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>fires
were ready to be lighted on the surrounding
hilltops.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 421px;">
<img src="images/illus176.jpg" width="421" height="640" alt="The Old South Church, Boston." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Old South Church, Boston.</span>
</div>

<p>The morning of December 16th had come. If the
tea should remain in the harbor until the morrow&mdash;the
twentieth day&mdash;the revenue officer would be empowered
by law to land it by force. Men, talking
angrily and shaking their fists with excitement, were
thronging into the streets of Boston from surrounding
towns. By ten o'clock over 7,000 had assembled
in the Old South Church and in the streets outside.</p>

<p>They were waiting for the coming of Benjamin
Rotch, who had gone to see if the collector would
give him a clearance. Rotch
came in and told the angry
crowd that the collector refused
to give the clearance.
The people told him that he
must get a pass from the Governor.
Fearing for his personal
safety, the poor man
started out to find Governor
Hutchinson who had purposely
retired to his country home
at Milton. Then the meeting
adjourned for the morning.</p>

<p>At three o'clock a great
throng of eager men again crowded into the Old
South Church and the streets outside to wait for the
return of Rotch. It was a critical moment. "If the
Governor refuses to give the pass, shall the revenue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
officer be allowed to seize the tea and land it to-morrow
morning?" Many anxious faces showed that
men were asking themselves this momentous question.</p>

<p>But while, in deep suspense, the meeting waited
and deliberated, John Rowe said, "Who knows how
tea will mingle with salt water?" A whirlwind of
applause swept through the assembly and the masses
outside the church. As daylight deepened into darkness,
candles were lighted. Shortly after six Benjamin
Rotch entered the church and, with pale face, said,
"The Governor refuses to give a pass." An angry
murmur arose, but the crowd soon became silent,
when Samuel Adams arose and said, "This meeting
can do nothing more to save the country."</p>

<p>This was plainly a concerted signal. In an instant
a war-whoop sounded, and forty or fifty "Mohawks,"
or men dressed as Indians, who were waiting outside,
dashed past the door and down Milk Street toward
Griffin's Wharf, where the tea-ships were lying at
anchor. It was bright moonlight, and everything
could be plainly seen. Many men stood on shore
and watched the "Mohawks" as they broke open 342
chests, and poured the tea into the harbor. There was
no confusion. All was done in perfect order.</p>

<p>The "Boston Tea Party," of which Samuel Adams
was the prime mover, was a long step toward the Revolution.
Samuel Adams was at this time almost or quite
alone in his desire for Independence, and he has well
been called the "Father of the Revolution." But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
his influence for the good of America continued far
beyond the time of the "Boston Tea Party." Up to
the last his patriotism was earnest and sincere. He
died in 1803, at the age of eighty-one years. Not as
an orator, like Patrick Henry, but as a man of action,
like Lincoln and Washington, had he a powerful influence
over men. His was truly a life of distinguished
service to his country.</p>

<p>After the "Boston Tea Party," affairs became
more serious than ever in Massachusetts. As
a punishment to the rebellious colonists for daring to
oppose their royal master, the English authorities closed
the port of Boston to all trade, and made General Gage
military governor of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of the new Governor was to dismiss
the Colonial Assembly, thus depriving the people
of their right to make laws, and subjecting them wholly
to the will of the King. The colonists felt this to
be an outrage upon free government, and immediately
organized a new governing body which they called a
Provincial Congress. With John Hancock as its president
and Samuel Adams as its leading spirit, this congress
began at once to make rapid preparations for
war. It called for an army of 20,000 men who were
to be ready, at a minute's notice, to march to any point<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
of danger. These first soldiers of the Revolution, thus
hastily mustered, were called "minute-men."</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Gage, who was in command of
3,000 British troops in Boston, had received orders
from England to seize John Hancock and Samuel
Adams as traitors. General Gage knew that Hancock
and Adams were staying for a while with a friend in
Lexington. He had learned also through his spies
that the minute-men had collected some cannon and
military stores in Concord, eighteen miles from Boston.
The British General planned, therefore, to send
a body of troops to arrest the two leaders at Lexington,
and then to push on and destroy the stores at
Concord.</p>

<p>Although he acted with the greatest secrecy, he was
not alert enough to keep his plans from the watchful
minute-men. Gage's failure was brought about by one
of these minute-men, Paul Revere, whose famous
"midnight ride" was one of the exciting episodes of
the Revolution.</p>

<p>Paul Revere was born in Boston, in 1735, in what is
now called the north end of the town. He followed
his father's trade, and became a goldsmith. To this
occupation he added copper-plate engraving, and not
only produced prints of many current events, but engraved
plates for money issued by the Provincial Congress
of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>He had taken an active part in the "Boston Tea
Party," and in 1774, with about thirty other young patriots,
formed a society to spy out the British plans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Always on the watch, these young men at once made
known any suspicious movement to such leaders as Samuel
Adams, John Hancock, and Dr. Joseph Warren.</p>

<p>On the evening of April 18, 1775, Revere and
his friends reported
to Dr. Warren certain
unusual movements
of troops and
boats, and their belief
that General
Gage was about to
carry out his plan
of capturing
Adams and Hancock
and of destroying the military stores at Concord.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus182.jpg" width="800" height="557" alt="Paul Revere's Ride." title="" />
<span class="caption">Paul Revere's Ride.</span>
</div>

<p>Dr. Warren quickly summoned William Dawes and
Paul Revere, and despatched them on horseback to
Lexington and Concord, to give the alarm. He sent
them by different routes, hoping that one at least might
escape capture by British patrols, with whom Gage had
carefully guarded all the roads leading from Boston.</p>

<p>Dawes was soon making his way across Boston Neck,
while Paul Revere went home and put on his riding
suit for his long night-ride. Then, leaving orders for
a lantern-signal to be hung in the belfry of the Old
North Church, to indicate by which route the British
forces were advancing, "one if by land and two if
by sea," he rowed across the Charles River, passing
near the British war-vessels lying at anchor.</p>

<p>On the opposite bank he soon got ready a fleet horse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
There he stood, bridle in hand, watching to catch sight
of the signal lights. At eleven o'clock two lights
gleamed out from the belfry, and told him that the
British troops were crossing the Charles River on their
march through Cambridge.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/illus183.jpg" width="351" height="640" alt="The Old North Church." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Old North Church.</span>
</div>

<p>Leaping into his saddle he sped like the wind
toward Lexington. Suddenly two British officers
sprang out to capture him; but quickly turning his
horse, he dashed into a side path, and soon outdistanced
his pursuers. Ten minutes later he arrived at
Medford.</p>

<p>Then at every house along the road, he stopped
and shouted, "Up and arm! Up and arm! The
regulars are out! The regulars are
out!"</p>

<p>When he reached Lexington it
was just midnight. Eight minute-men,
guarding the house where
Adams and Hancock were sleeping,
warned him not to disturb the
household by making so much
noise. "Noise!" cried Paul Revere.
"You'll have noise enough before
long. The regulars are out!"</p>

<p>William Dawes soon joined Paul
Revere, and after a few minutes
spent in taking refreshments they
rode off together toward Concord accompanied by
Dr. Prescott. About half way there they met some
mounted British officers, who called to them to halt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Prescott managed to escape by making his horse leap
a stone wall, and rode in hot haste toward Concord,
which he reached in safety; but Paul Revere and
William Dawes both fell into the hands of the
British.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the British troops, numbering 800
men, under Lieutenant-Colonel Smith, were on their
way to Lexington. But they had not gone far before
they were made aware, by the ringing of church-bells,
the firing of signal guns, the beating of drums, and
the gleaming of beacon-fires from the surrounding hilltops,
that the minute-men knew of their movements.
Colonel Smith, disturbed by these signs of threatening
storm, sent Major Pitcairn ahead with a picked body
of light infantry, in the hope that they might reach
Lexington before the town could be aroused. He then
sent back to Boston for reinforcements.</p>

<p>The British commander had reason to be disturbed,
for the alarm-signals were calling to arms thousands of
patriots ready to die for their rights. Hastily wakened
from sleep, men snatched their old muskets from over
the door and, bidding a hurried good-by to wife and
children, started for the meeting-places long since agreed
upon.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was rising, Major Pitcairn marched
into Lexington, where he found forty or fifty minute-men
ready to dispute his advance. "Disperse, ye
rebels: disperse!" he cried. But they would not disperse.
Pitcairn ordered his men to fire, and eighteen
of the minute-men fell dead or wounded, before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
remainder sullenly retired to wait for a hand in the
struggle later in the day.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of Pitcairn the British officers
who had captured Revere and Dawes returned with
them to Lexington,
where, commanding
Revere to dismount,
they let him go. Running
off at full speed
to the house where
Samuel Adams and
John Hancock were
staying, he recounted
what had happened,
and then guided them
across the fields to a
place of safety at Woburn. On their way they heard
the guns firing on Lexington Common, and the sound
stirred the soul of Adams, who exclaimed with enthusiasm,
"Oh, what a glorious morning is this!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 704px;">

Marking the Line of the Minute-Men." title="" />
<span class="caption">Stone in Front of the Harrington House, Lexington,
Marking the Line of the Minute-Men.</span>
</div>

<p>From Lexington, Colonel Smith hastened to Concord,
arriving there at seven o'clock in the morning,
about six hours after Dr. Prescott had given the alarm.
The British could not find the military stores, most
of which the people of Concord had hidden, but they
cut down the liberty pole, set fire to the court-house,
spiked a few cannon, and emptied some barrels of
flour.</p>

<p>About 200 of them stood guard at the North
Bridge, while a body of minute-men gathered on a hill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
beyond. When the minute-men had increased to 400
they advanced upon the British, and brought on a fight
which resulted in loss of life on each side. Then continuing
their advance they crossed the bridge, and
forced the British to withdraw into the town.</p>

<p>By noon Colonel Smith could see that by reason of
the ever-increasing body of minute-men, swarming into
Concord from every direction, it would be unwise to
delay his return to Boston. His men had marched
eighteen miles with little or no food for fourteen hours,
and were tired and hungry.</p>

<p>But when the British started back on their return
march, the minute-men followed and began a deadly
attack. It was an irregular fight. The minute-men,
trained to woodland warfare, slipped from tree to tree,
shot down the tired British soldiers, and then retreated
only to return and repeat the annoying attack. The
wooded country through which they marched favored
this kind of fighting.</p>

<p>But even in the open country every stone wall and
hill, every house and barn, seemed to the exhausted
British troops to bristle with the guns of minute-men.
The retreating army pushed wearily forward, fighting
as bravely as possible, but on the verge of confusion
and panic.</p>

<p>When they reached Lexington Common, at two
o'clock, they met 1,200 fresh troops under Lord Percy,
whose timely arrival saved the entire force from capture.
The dismayed British troops, half-dead with exhaustion,
entered the square Lord Percy had formed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for their protection, and fell upon the ground, "with
their tongues hanging out of their mouths like those of
dogs after a chase."</p>

</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>
<p>After resting for an hour, the British again took up
their march to Boston. The minute-men, increasing
in numbers every moment, kept up the same kind of
running attack that they had made upon the British
between Concord and Lexington. A British officer, in
speaking of the minute-men, said, "they seemed to
have dropped from the clouds." The condition of the
British soldiers was pitiable until, late in the day, they
got under the protection of the guns of the war-vessels
in Boston Harbor.</p>

<p>The British had failed. They had been driven back,
almost in a panic, to Boston, with a loss of nearly 300
men. The Americans had not lost 100. It was a
great day for the patriots, for they had not only defeated
the regular troops, but they had tested their own
strength and given fresh inspiration to their cause.
Farmers, mechanics, men in all walks of life, now flocked
to the army. Within a few days the Americans,
16,000 strong, were surrounding the British in Boston.</p>

<p>The Americans, eager to drive them out of Boston,
threw up breastworks on Bunker Hill, which overlooked
the town. But the next day&mdash;June 17th&mdash;after
they had twice driven the redcoats down the
hill&mdash;they had to retreat because their powder had
given out. This was the battle of Bunker Hill, in
which the British lost in killed and wounded 1,000
men; the Americans, 450.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Paul Revere took part in no important
battle, he was active in the patriot cause, and became
lieutenant-colonel of a Boston regiment of artillery.
After the war he returned to his old business, and established
a foundry in which church-bells and bronze cannon
were cast. He died in Boston in 1818, eighty-three
years of age, held in high esteem by his countrymen.</p>

<p>American independence, the beginnings of
which we have just been considering, was accomplished
after a long struggle. Many brave men fought
on the battle-field, and many who never shouldered a
musket or drew a sword exerted a powerful influence
for the good of the patriot cause. One of these men
was Benjamin Franklin.</p>

<p>He was born in Boston in 1706, the fifteenth child in
a family of seventeen children. His father was a candle-maker
and soap-boiler. Intending to make a clergyman
of Benjamin, he sent him, at eight years of age, to a
grammar-school, with the purpose of fitting him for college.
The boy made rapid progress, but before the end
of his first school-year his father took him out on account
of the expense, and put him into a school where he would
learn more practical subjects, such as writing and arithmetic.
The last study proved very difficult for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Two years later, at the age of ten, he had to go
into his father's shop. Here he spent his time in cutting
wicks for the candles, filling the moulds with
tallow, selling soap in the shop, and acting the part of
errand-boy.</p>

<p>Many times he had watched the vessels sailing in
and out of Boston Harbor, and often in imagination
had gone with them on their journeys. Now he longed
to become a sailor, and, quitting the drudgery of the
candle-shop, to roam out over the sea in search of more
interesting life. But his father wisely refused to let
him go. His fondness for the sea, however, took him
frequently to the water, and he learned to swim like a
fish and to row and sail boats with great skill. In
these sports, as in others, he became a leader among his
playmates.</p>

<p>With all his dislike for the business of candle-making
and soap-boiling, and with all his fondness for
play, he was faithful in doing everything that his father's
business required. His industry, together with
his liking for good books and his keen desire for
knowledge, went far toward supplying the lack of
school-training. He spent most of his leisure in
reading, and devoted his savings to collecting a small
library.</p>

<p>His father, noting his bookish habits, decided to
apprentice Benjamin to his older brother, James, a
printer in Boston. Benjamin was to serve until he
was twenty-one and to receive no wages until the last
year. In this position he was able to see more of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
books, and made good use of his opportunities.
Often he would read, far into the night, a borrowed
book that had to be returned in the morning. He
also wrote some verses and peddled them about the
streets, until his father discouraged him by ridiculing
his efforts.</p>

<p>About this time, in order to get money for books, he
told his brother that he would be willing to board
himself on half the money the board had been costing.
To this his brother agreed, and Benjamin lived on a
very meagre diet. Remaining in the printing-office at
noon, he ate such a simple lunch as a biscuit or slice
of bread and a bunch or two of raisins. As a meal
like this required but little time, young Franklin could
spend most of the noon hour in reading. By living
thus he easily saved half of what his brother allowed
him, and at once spent his savings in books.</p>

<p>This youth was never idle, because he put a high
value upon time; he was never wasteful of money,
because he knew the easiest way to make money was
to save what he had. These were qualities which
helped Benjamin Franklin to get on in the world.</p>

<p>But during this period of his life he had great hardships
to bear, for his brother was a stern taskmaster, and
was so hot-tempered that he would sometimes beat
Benjamin cruelly. No doubt the young apprentice
was sometimes at fault. Be that as it may, the two
brothers had so many disagreements that Benjamin determined
to run away and seek his fortune elsewhere.</p>

<p>Having sold some of his books to get a little money,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
at the age of seventeen, he secured a passage on board
a sloop for New York. Upon his arrival, friendless and
almost penniless, he began to visit the printing-offices
in search of work. But failing to find any, and being
told that he would be
more likely to succeed
in Philadelphia,
he decided to go to
that city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus193.jpg" width="600" height="601" alt="Franklin's Journey from New York to Philadelphia." title="" />
<span class="caption">Franklin's Journey from New York to Philadelphia.</span>
</div>

<p>To-day, the journey
from New York
to Philadelphia, a
distance of ninety
miles, can be made in
two hours. But, of
course, in Franklin's
time there were no
railroads, and it was a more difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>He first had to go by a sail-boat from New York to
Amboy, on the New Jersey coast. On the way a storm
came up, which tore the sails and drove the boat to
the Long Island shore. All night Franklin lay in the
hold, while the waves dashed angrily over the boat.
At length, after thirty hours, during which he was
without food or water, he was landed at Amboy.</p>

<p>As he had no money to spare for coach hire, he
started to walk, along rough country roads, the fifty
miles across New Jersey to Burlington. For over
two days he trudged along in a downpour of rain.
At the end of his first day's journey he was so wet and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
mud-spattered, and had such an appearance of neglect,
that on reaching an inn, there was talk of arresting
him for a runaway servant.</p>

<p>Having arrived at Burlington, he was still twenty
miles from Philadelphia, and boarded a boat for the
remainder of his journey. As there was no wind, the
passengers had to take turns at the oars, and in this
way they continued down the Delaware until midnight.
Then fearing they might pass the town in the darkness&mdash;streets
not being lighted in those days&mdash;they
landed, made a fire out of some fence-rails, and waited
for morning.</p>

<p>The next day, which was Sunday, they reached Philadelphia,
and young Franklin, poorly clad and travel-soiled,
with only a little money in his pocket, was making
his way alone through the streets of Philadelphia.
But he was cheerful and full of hope. His health was
strong, and he was hungry for his breakfast. Going to
a baker's shop he bought three large rolls, and, his
pockets being already stuffed with shirts and stockings,
he tucked one roll under each arm, and walked up
Market Street eating the third. His ludicrous appearance
afforded much amusement to a certain Deborah
Read, who stood at the door of her father's house
as he passed by. Little did she think that this strange-looking
fellow would one day become the greatest man
in Philadelphia and even in Pennsylvania. Little did
she think that one day, not many years after that morning
she would become his wife. Both these things
came to pass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>Having eaten as much as he wished, he continued
up the street, giving the two other rolls to a woman
and a child who had come on the boat with him.</p>

<p>In a short time he found work with one of the two
master-printers in Philadelphia. One day, while at
work in the printing-office, he received a call from Sir
William Keith, Governor of Pennsylvania. Governor
Keith's attention had been directed to this seventeen-year-old
youth by Franklin's brother-in-law, and he
called on this occasion to urge him to start a printing-press
of his own.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 594px;">
<img src="images/illus195.jpg" width="594" height="480" alt="Franklin in the Streets of Philadelphia." title="" />
<span class="caption">Franklin in the Streets of Philadelphia.</span>
</div>

<p>When Franklin said he had not the money to buy a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
printing-press and type, the Governor offered to write
a letter for Franklin to take to his father in Boston,
asking him to furnish the loan. The following spring
Franklin took the letter to his father, but the father
refused to lend him the money.</p>

<p>Upon Franklin's return to Philadelphia Governor
Keith advised him to go to England to select the
printing-press and other things necessary for the business
outfit, promising to provide funds. Franklin took
him at his word, and sailed for London, expecting to
secure the money upon his arrival there. But the
faithless Governor failed to keep his word, and Franklin
was again stranded in a strange city.</p>

<p>Without friends and without money he once more
found work in a printing-office, where he remained
during the two years of his stay in London. Here,
in his manliness and strength, he was very different
from the printers with whom he worked. They
spent much of their money in beer-drinking, and
when Franklin refused to drink with them, they
made fun of him, by calling him a water-American.
But the young man who had lived upon a simple
diet in order to buy books was not disturbed by such
taunts.</p>

<p>After two years he returned to Philadelphia, where,
four years later, he married Miss Read. In the meantime
he had set up in the printing business for himself,
but in so doing had to carry a heavy debt. He
worked early and late to pay it off, sometimes making
his own ink and casting his own type. He would also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
at times go with a wheel-barrow to bring to the printing-office
the paper he needed.</p>

<p>His wife assisted him by selling stationery in his
shop as well as by saving in the household, where the
furnishings and food were very simple. Franklin's
usual breakfast was milk and bread, which he ate out
of a wooden porringer with a pewter spoon. In time,
when their money was more plentiful, his wife gave him
a China bowl and a silver spoon. On observing how
hard Franklin worked, people said, "There is a man
who will surely succeed. Let us help him."</p>

<p>In all these years of struggle Franklin was cheerful
and light-hearted. This was no doubt largely owing
to his natural disposition, but in part also to his healthful
reading habits, which took him into a world outside
of himself. No matter where he was or what
the stress of his business, he found time to read and
improve himself. He also adopted rules of conduct,
some of which, in substance, are: Be temperate; speak
honestly; be orderly about your work; do not waste
anything; never be idle; when you decide to do anything,
do it with a brave heart.</p>

<p>Some of the wisest things Franklin ever said appeared
in his Almanac, which he called "Poor Richard's
Almanac." Beginning when he was twenty-six
years of age, he published it yearly for twenty-five
years, building up a very large circulation. It contained
many homely maxims, which are as good to-day
as they were in Franklin's time. Here are a few of
them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Franklin always had a deep interest in the public
welfare. He started a subscription library in Philadelphia
and established an academy, which finally grew into
the University of Pennsylvania. Having a decidedly
practical turn of mind, he had great influence in organizing
a better police force and a better fire department.
He invented the Franklin stove, which soon became
popular because it was so much better than the open fireplace.
But the most wonderful thing he ever did was
proving that lightning was the same thing as electricity.</p>

<p>Before he made this discovery, men of science had
learned how to store up electricity in what is called a
Leyden jar. But Franklin wished to find out something
about the lightning which flashed across the
clouds during a thunder-storm. Therefore, making a
kite out of silk and fastening to it a small iron rod,
he attached to the kite and to the iron rod a string
made of hemp.</p>

<p>One day when a thunder-cloud was coming up he
went out with his little son and took his stand under
a shelter in the open field. At one end of the hempen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
string was fastened an iron key, and to this was tied a
silken string, which Franklin held in his hand. As
electricity will not run through silk, by using this silken
string he protected himself against the electric current.</p>

<span class="caption">Franklin Experimenting with Electricity.</span>
</div>

<p>When the kite rose high into the air, Franklin
watched intently to see what might follow. After a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
while the fibres of the hempen string began to move,
and then, putting his knuckles near the key, Franklin
drew forth sparks of electricity. He was delighted,
for he had proved that the lightning in the clouds was
the same thing as the electricity that men of science
could make with machines.</p>

<p>It was a great discovery and made Benjamin Franklin
famous. From some of the leading universities of
Europe he received the title of <i>Doctor</i>, and he was now
recognized as one of the great men of the world.</p>

<p>Franklin rendered his country distinguished public
services, only a few of which we can here mention.
More than twenty years before the outbreak of the
Revolution, he perceived that the principal source of
weakness among the colonies was their lack of union.
With this great weakness in mind, Franklin proposed,
in 1754, at a time when the French were threatening
to cut off the English from the Ohio Valley, his
famous "Plan of Union." Although it failed, it
prepared the colonies for union in the struggle against
King George and the English Parliament.</p>

<p>Ten years after proposing the "Plan of Union"
Franklin was sent to England, at the time of the agitation
over the Stamp Act, to make a strenuous effort to
prevent its passage. He was unsuccessful in accomplishing
his mission, but later did much toward securing
the repeal of the Stamp Act.</p>

<p>Returning from England two weeks after the battle
of Lexington and Concord, he immediately took a
prominent part in the Revolution. He was one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the five appointed as a committee to write the Declaration
of Independence, and during the discussion over
that remarkable State paper, it was he that said, "Yes,
we must indeed all hang together, or assuredly we
shall all hang separately."</p>

<span class="caption">Lafayette Offering His Services to Franklin</span>
</div>

<p>After the signing of the Declaration of Independence
on July 4, 1776, he was sent to France to secure aid
for the American cause. The French people gave him
a cordial reception. There were feasts and parades in
his honor, crowds followed him on the streets, and his
pictures were everywhere displayed. The simplicity
and directness of this white-haired man of seventy years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
charmed the French people, and won for him a warm
place in their hearts. On one of the great occasions a
very beautiful woman was appointed to place a crown
of laurel upon his white locks, "and to give the old
man two kisses on his cheeks." All this was a sincere
expression of admiration and esteem. He did very
much to secure from France the aid which that country
gave to us. He indeed rendered to his country
services<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> whose value may well be compared with those
of Washington.</p>

<p>Franklin left France in 1785, after having ably represented
his country for ten years. All France was
sorry to have him leave. Since it was hard for him to
endure the motion of a carriage, the King sent one of
the Queen's litters in which he was carried to the coast.
He also bore with him a portrait of the King of France
"framed in a double circle of four hundred and eight
diamonds."</p>

<p>Although in his last years he had to endure much
idleness and pain, yet he was uniformly patient and
cheerful, loving life to the end. He died in 1790, at
the age of eighty-four, one of the greatest of American
statesmen and heroes.</p>

<p>We left George Washington at Mount Vernon,
his extensive plantation on the Virginia bank
of the Potomac River. After his marriage with Mrs.
Custis, who had large property of her own, Washington
became a man of much wealth. He was at one
time one of the largest landholders in America. As a
manager of all this property, he had much to do. Let
us delay our story a little to get a glimpse of the life
led by him and other Virginia planters of his time.</p>

<p>The plantations were scattered along the rivers,
sometimes many miles apart, with densely wooded
stretches of land lying between. Each planter had his
own wharf whence vessels, once a year, carried away his
tobacco to England, and brought back in exchange
whatever manufactured goods he required.</p>

<p>Nearly all his needs could be supplied at his wharf
or on his plantation. His slaves included not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
workers in large tobacco-fields, but such skilled workmen
as millers, weavers, tailors, wheelwrights, coopers,
shoemakers, and carpenters. Washington said to his
overseers, "Buy nothing that you can make within
yourselves." Indeed, each plantation was a little world
in itself. Hence towns containing shops with goods
and supplies of various kinds did not spring up much
in Virginia.</p>

<p>The mansion of the planter, built of brick or wood
and having at either end a huge chimney, was two
stories high, with a large veranda outside and a wide
hall-way inside. Near by were the storehouses, barns,
workshops, and slave quarters. These last consisted of
simple wooden cabins surrounded by gardens, where
the negroes raised such things as vegetables and water-melons
for their own use. In fact, the mansion and
all the buildings clustered about it looked like a village.
Here we could have seen, at all hours of the day,
swarms of negro children playing happily together.</p>

<p>The planter spent most of his time in the open air,
with his dogs and his horses. Washington gave to his
horses rather fanciful
names, such as Ajax,
Blueskin, Valiant, and
Magnolia, and to his
dogs, Vulcan, Sweetlips,
Ringwood, Forrester, and Rockwood. Out-door
recreations included fishing, shooting, and horse-racing.</p>

<span class="caption">Washington's Coach.</span>
</div>

<p>Although life on the plantation was without luxury,
there was everywhere a plain and homely abundance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
Visitors were sure to meet a cordial welcome. It was
no uncommon thing for a planter to entertain an entire
family for weeks, and then to pay a similar visit in return
with his own family. Social life absorbed much
of Washington's time at
Mount Vernon, where
visitors were nearly always
present. The planter,
often living many miles
away from any other human
habitation, was only
too glad to have a traveller
spend the night with
him and give news of the outside world. Such a visit
was somewhat like the coming of the newspaper into
our homes to-day.</p>

<span class="caption">A Stage Coach of the Eighteenth Century.</span>
</div>

<p>We must remember that travelling was no such simple
and easy matter then as it is now. As the planters
in Virginia usually lived on the banks of one of the
many rivers, the simplest method of travel was by boat,
up or down stream. There were cross-country roads,
but these at best were rough, and sometimes full of
roots and stumps. Often they were nothing more than
forest paths. In trying to follow such roads the traveller
at times lost his way and occasionally had to spend
a night in the woods. But with even such makeshifts
for roads, the planter had his lumbering old coach to
which, on state occasions, he harnessed six horses and
drove in great style.</p>

<p>Washington was in full sympathy with this life, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
threw himself heartily into the work of managing his
immense property. He lived up to his favorite motto,
"If you want a thing done, do it yourself." He kept
his own books, and looked with exactness after the
smallest details.</p>

<p>He was indeed one of the most methodical of men,
and thus accomplished a marvellous amount of work.
By habit an early riser, he was often up before daylight
in winter. On such occasions he kindled his
own fire and read or worked by the light of a candle.
At seven in summer and at eight in winter he sat
down to a simple breakfast, consisting of two cups of
tea, and hoe-cakes made of Indian meal. After breakfast
he rode on horseback over his plantation to look
after his slaves, often spending much of the day in the
saddle superintending the work. At two he ate dinner,
early in the evening he took tea, and at nine o'clock
went to bed.</p>

<p>As he did not spare himself, he expected faithful
service from everyone. But to his many slaves he
was a kind master, and he took good care of the sick
or feeble. It may be a comfort to some of us to learn
that Washington was fonder of active life than of reading
books, for which he never seemed to get much
time. But he was even less fond of public speaking.
Like some other great men, he found it difficult to
stand up before a body of people and make a speech.
After his term of service in the French and Indian
War he was elected to the House of Burgesses, where
he received a vote of thanks for his brave military ser<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>vices.
Rising to reply, Washington stood blushing and
stammering, without being able to say a word. The
Speaker, equal to the occasion, said with much grace,
"Sit down, Mr. Washington, your modesty equals your
valor, and that surpasses the power of any language to
express."</p>

<p>While for many years after the close of the Last
French War this modest, home-loving man was living
the life of a high-bred Virginia gentleman, the exciting
events which finally brought on the Revolution were
stirring men's souls to heroic action. It was natural,
in these trying days, that his countrymen should look
for guidance and inspiration to George Washington,
who had been so conspicuous a leader in the Last
French War.</p>

<p>He represented Virginia at the first meeting of the
Continental Congress in 1774, going to Philadelphia in
company with Patrick Henry and others. He was also
a delegate from his colony at the second meeting
of the Continental Congress in May, 1775. On being
elected by this body Commander-in-Chief of the American
army, he at once thanked the members for the
election, and added, "I do not think myself equal to
the command I am honored with." He also refused
to receive any salary for his services, but said he would
keep an account of the expenses he might incur, in
order that these might be paid back to him.</p>

<p>On the 21st of June Washington set out on horseback
from Philadelphia, in company with a small body
of horsemen, to take command of the American army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
around Boston. Not long after starting they met a
messenger bringing in haste the news of the Battle of
Bunker Hill. Washington eagerly asked, "Did the
Americans stand the fire of the regular troops?"
"Yes," was the proud answer. "Then," cried Washington,
gladly, "the liberties of the country are
safe!"</p>

<p>Three days later, about four o'clock on Sunday
afternoon, he reached New York, where he met with a
royal welcome. Riding in an open carriage drawn by
two white horses, he passed through the streets, escorted
by nine companies of soldiers on foot. Along
the route the people, old and young, received him
with enthusiasm. At New Haven the Yale College
students came out in a body, keeping step to the music
of a band of which Noah Webster, the future lexicographer,
then a freshman, was the leader. On July 2d,
after arriving at the camp in Cambridge, Washington
received an equally enthusiastic welcome from the
soldiers.</p>

<p>Next day General Washington rode out on horseback
and, under the famous elm still standing near
Harvard University, drew his sword and took command
of the American army. He was then forty-three
years old, with a tall, manly form and a noble
face. He was good to look at as he sat there, a perfect
picture of manly strength and dignity, wearing an
epaulet on each shoulder, a broad band of blue silk
across his breast, and a three-cornered hat with the
cockade of liberty in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Now came the labor of getting his troops into good
condition for fighting battles, for his army was one
only in name. These untrained men were brave and
willing, but without muskets and without powder, they
were in no condition for making war on a well-equipped
enemy.</p>

<p>Moreover, the army had no cannon, without which
it could not hope to succeed in an attack upon the
British troops in Boston. By using severe measures,
however, Washington soon brought about much better
discipline. But with no powder and no cannon, he
had to let the autumn and the winter slip by before
making any effort to drive the British army out of
Boston. When cannon and other supplies were at last
brought down from Ticonderoga on sledges drawn by
oxen, the alert American General fortified Dorchester
Heights, which overlooked the city, and forced the
English commander to sail away with all his army.</p>

<p>Washington believed that the next movement of the
British would be to get control of the Hudson River
and the Middle States. So he went promptly to New
York in order to defend it against attack. But still
his army was weak in numbers as well as in provisions,
equipment, and training.</p>

<p>Washington had only about 18,000 men to meet
General Howe, who soon arrived off Staten Island
with a large fleet and 30,000 men. Not knowing
where the British General would strike first, Washington
had to be on his guard at many points. He had
to prepare a defence of a line of twenty miles. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
also built, on opposite sides of the Hudson River just
above New York, Forts Lee and Washington.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 484px;">
<img src="images/illus211.jpg" width="484" height="800" alt="Map Illustrating the Battle of Long
Island." title="" />
<span class="caption">Map Illustrating the Battle of Long
Island.</span>
</div>

<p>When Brooklyn Heights, on Long Island, had been
fortified, General Putnam went with half the army
to occupy them. On August
27th General Howe, with
something like 20,000 men,
attacked a part of these forces
and defeated them. If he had
continued the battle by marching
at once against the remainder,
he might have captured
all that part of Washington's
army under Putnam's command.
He might, also, have
captured Washington himself,
who, during the heat of the
battle, had crossed over to
Long Island.</p>

<p>If Howe had done this, he
might have ended the war at one stroke. But his men
had fought hard at the end of a long night-march and
needed rest. Besides, he thought it would be easy
enough to capture the Americans without undue haste.
For how could they escape? Soon the British vessels
would sail up and get between them and New
York, when, of course, escape for Washington and
his men would be impossible. This all seemed so
clear to the easy-going General Howe that he gave
his tired men a rest after the battle on the 27th. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the 28th a heavy rain fell, and on the 29th a dense
fog covered the island.</p>

<p>But before midday of the 29th some American
officers riding down toward the shore, noticed an
unusual stir in the British fleet. Boats were going to
and fro, as if carrying orders. "Very likely," said
these officers to Washington, "the English vessels are
to sail up between New York and Long Island, to cut
off our retreat." As that was also Washington's opinion,
he secured all the boats he could find for the purpose
of trying to make an escape during the night.</p>

<p>It was a desperate undertaking. There were 10,000
men, and the width of the river at the point of crossing
was nearly a mile. It would seem hardly possible
that such a movement could, in a single night, be
made without discovery by the British troops, who
were lying in camp but a short distance away. The
night must have been a long and anxious one for
Washington, who stayed at his post of duty on the
Long Island shore until the last boat of the retreating
army had pushed off. The escape was a brilliant
achievement and saved the American cause.</p>

<p>But this was only the beginning of Washington's
troubles in this memorable year, 1776. As the British
now occupied Brooklyn Heights, which overlooked
New York, the Americans could not hold that place,
and in a short time they had to withdraw, fighting
stubbornly as they slowly retreated. Washington
crossed over to the Jersey side of the Hudson, and
left General Charles Lee with half the army at North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Castle. The British captured Forts Lee and Washington,
with 3,000 men, inflicting a severe loss upon
the American cause. The outlook was gloomy, but
more trying events were to follow.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the British from capturing Philadelphia,
Washington put his army between them and
that city. The British began to move upon him.
Needing every soldier that he could get, he sent orders
to General Lee to join him. Lee refused to move.
Again and again Washington urged Lee to come to his
aid. Each time Lee disobeyed. We now know that
he was a traitor, secretly hoping that Washington
might fail in order that he himself, who was second
in command, might become Commander-in-Chief of
the American army.</p>

<p>Lee's disobedience placed Washington in a critical
position. In order to save his army from capture,
Washington had to retreat once more, this time across
New Jersey toward Philadelphia. As the British army,
in every way superior to Washington's, was close upon
the Americans, it was a race for life. Sometimes the
rear-guard of the Americans was just leaving a burning
bridge when the van of the British army could be seen
approaching. But by burning bridges and destroying
food supplies intended for the British, Washington so
delayed them that they were nineteen days in marching
about sixty miles.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the situation for the Americans was
still desperate. To make matters worse, Washington
saw his army gradually melting away by desertion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
When he reached the Delaware River it numbered
barely 3,000 men.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Having collected boats for seventy miles along the
Delaware, Washington succeeded in safely crossing it
a little above Trenton, on December 8th. As the
British had no boats, they were obliged to wait until
the river should freeze, when they intended to cross in
triumph and make an easy capture of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>To most people, in England and in America alike,
the early downfall of the American cause seemed certain.
General Cornwallis&mdash;who in May of this year
had joined the British army in America&mdash;was so sure
that the war would soon come to an end, that he had
already packed some of his luggage and sent it aboard
ship, with the intention of returning to England at an
early day.</p>

<p>But Washington had no thought of giving up the
struggle. Far from being disheartened, he confronted
the gloomy outlook with all his energy and courage.
Fearless and full of faith in the patriot cause, he
watched with vigilance for an opportunity to turn suddenly
upon his over-confident enemy and strike a heavy
blow.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Such an opportunity shortly came to him. The
British General had carelessly separated his army into
several divisions and scattered them at various points
in New Jersey. One of these divisions, consisting of
Hessians, was stationed at Trenton. Washington's
quick eye noted this blunder of the British General,
and he resolved to take advantage of it by attacking
the Hessians at Trenton on Christmas night. Having
been re-enforced, he now had an army of 6,000
and was therefore in a better condition to risk a battle.
With 2,400 picked men he got ready to cross the
Delaware River at a point nine miles above Trenton.
There was snow on the ground, and the weather was
bitterly cold. As the soldiers marched to the place
of crossing, some of them with feet almost bare left
bloody footprints along the route.</p>

<p>At sunset the troops began to cross. It was a terrible
night for such an undertaking. Angry gusts of
wind, and great blocks of ice swept along by the swift
current, threatened every moment to dash in pieces the
frail boats. From the Trenton side of the river, General
Knox, who had been sent ahead by Washington,
loudly shouted to let the struggling boatmen know
where to land. Ten hours were consumed in the
crossing. Much longer must the time have seemed to
Washington, as he stood in the midst of the wild
storm, his heart full of mingled anxiety and hope.</p>

<p>It was not until four o'clock in the morning that
the troops were ready to march upon Trenton, nine
miles away. As they advanced, a fearful storm of
snow and sleet beat upon the already weary men. But
they pushed forward, and surprised the Hessians at
Trenton soon after sunrise, easily capturing them after
a short struggle.</p>

<p>Washington had brought hope to every patriot
heart. The British were amazed at the daring feat,
and Cornwallis decided to make a longer stay in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
America. He soon advanced with a superior force
against Washington, and at nightfall, January 2, 1777,
took his stand on the farther side of a small creek.
"At last," said Cornwallis, "we have run down the old
fox, and we will bag him in the morning."</p>

<p>But Washington was too sly a fox for Cornwallis to
bag. During the night he led his army around Cornwallis's
camp, and pushing on to Princeton defeated
the rear-guard, which had not yet joined the main body.
He then retired in safety to his winter quarters among
the hills about Morristown. During this fateful campaign
Washington had handled his army in a masterly
way. He had begun with defeat and had ended with
victory.</p>

<p>In 1777 the British planned to get control of the
Hudson River, and thus cut off New England from the
other States. In this way they hoped so to weaken
the Americans as to make their defeat easy. Burgoyne
was to march from Canada, by way of Lake Champlain
and Fort Edward, to Albany, where he was to
meet not only a small force of British under St. Leger
from the Mohawk Valley, but also the main army of
18,000 men, under General Howe, which was expected
to sail up the Hudson from New York. The British
believed that this plan would be easily carried out and
would soon bring the war to a close.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>
<p>And this might have happened if General Howe
had not failed to do his part. Instead of going up to
meet and help Burgoyne, however, he tried first to
march across New Jersey and capture Philadelphia.
But when he reached Morristown, he found Washington
in a stronghold where he dared not attack him. As
Washington would not come out and risk an encounter
in the open field, and as Howe was unwilling to continue
his advance with the American army threatening
his rear, he returned to New York. Still desirous of
reaching Philadelphia, however, he sailed a little later,
with his army, to Chesapeake Bay. The voyage took
him two months.</p>

<p>When at length he advanced toward Philadelphia,
he found Washington ready to dispute his progress at
Brandywine Creek. There a battle was fought, resulting
in the defeat of the Americans. But Washington
handled his army with such skill that Howe spent two
weeks in reaching Philadelphia, only twenty-six miles
away.</p>

<p>When Howe arrived at the city he found out that it
was too late to send aid to Burgoyne, who was now in
desperate straits. Washington had spoiled the English
plan, and Burgoyne, failing to get the much-needed
help from Howe, had to surrender at Saratoga (October
17, 1777) his entire army of 6,000 regular troops.
This was a great blow to England, and resulted in a
treaty between France and America. After this treaty,
France sent over both land and naval forces, which
were of much service to the American cause.</p>

<p>At the close of 1777 Washington retired to a strong
position among the hills at Valley Forge, on the
Schuylkill River, about twenty miles northwest of Philadelphia.
Here his army spent a winter of terrible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
suffering. Most of the soldiers were in rags, only a
few had bed-clothing, and many had not even straw to
lie upon at night. Nearly 3,000 were barefoot. More
than this, they were often for days at a time without
bread. It makes one heartsick to read about the sufferings
of these patriotic men during this miserable
winter. But despite all the bitter trials of these distressing
times, Washington never lost faith in the final
success of the American cause.</p>

<p>A beautiful story is told of this masterful man at
Valley Forge. When "Friend Potts" was near the
camp one day, he heard an earnest voice. On approaching
he saw Washington on his knees, his cheeks
wet with tears, praying to God for help and guidance.
When the farmer returned to his home he said to his
wife: "George Washington will succeed! George
Washington will succeed! The Americans will secure
their independence!" "What makes thee think so,
Isaac?" inquired his wife. "I have heard him pray,
Hannah, out in the woods to-day, and the Lord will
surely hear his prayer. He will, Hannah; thee may
rest assured He will."</p>

<p>We may pass over without comment here the events
between the winter at Valley Forge and the Yorktown
campaign, which resulted in the surrender of Cornwallis
with all his army. Even when not engaged in fighting
battles, Washington was the soul of the American
cause, which could scarcely have succeeded without his
inspiring leadership. But there is yet one more military
event&mdash;the hemming in of Cornwallis at York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>town,&mdash;for
us to notice briefly before we take leave of
Washington.</p>

<p>When at the close of his fighting with General
Greene in the South, Cornwallis marched northward to
Yorktown, Washington, with an army of French and
American troops, was encamped on the Hudson River.
He was waiting for the coming of a French fleet to
New York. On its arrival he expected to attack the
British army there by land, while the fleet attacked it
by sea.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that the French fleet was on its way
to the Chesapeake, Washington thought out a brilliant
scheme. This was to march his army as quickly and
as secretly as possible to Yorktown, a distance of 400
miles, there to join Lafayette and to co-operate with
the French fleet in the capture of Cornwallis. The
scheme succeeded so well that Cornwallis surrendered
his entire army of 8,000 men on October 19, 1781.</p>

<p>This was the last battle of the war, although the
treaty of peace was not signed until 1783. By that
treaty the Americans won their independence from
England. The country which they could now call
their own extended from Canada to Florida, and from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>Washington, tired of war, was glad to become a Virginia
planter once more. But he was not permitted to
live in quiet. After his retirement from the army his
home became, as he himself said, a well-resorted tavern.
Two years after the close of the Revolution he
wrote in his diary: "Dined with only Mrs. Washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>ton,
which I believe is the first instance of it since my
retirement from public life."</p>

<p>When, on the formation of the Constitution of the
United States, the American people looked about for
a President, all eyes naturally turned to George Washington.
He was elected without opposition and was
inaugurated at New York, then the capital of the
United States, on April 30, 1789.</p>

<span class="caption">Washington's Home&mdash;Mount Vernon.</span>
</div>

<p>His life as President was one of dignity and elegance.
It was his custom to pay no calls and accept no invitations,
but between three and four o'clock on every
Tuesday afternoon he held a public reception. On
such occasions he appeared in court-dress, with powdered
hair, yellow gloves in his hand, a long sword in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
a scabbard of white polished leather at his side, and a
cocked hat under his arm. Standing with his right
hand behind him, he bowed formally as each guest
was presented to him.</p>

<p>After serving two terms as President with great success
he again retired in 1797 to private life at Mount
Vernon. Here he died on December 14, 1799, at
the age of sixty-seven, loved and honored by the
American people.</p>

<p>We have rapidly glanced at the course of the
Revolution so far as Washington was concerned
in it. But we should fail to understand the
connection of events were we to pass over without
mention the work of the brilliant general, Nathaniel
Greene, who by common consent is regarded as a military
leader second to Washington alone.</p>

<p>As already noted, the first fighting in the Revolution
was in New England. Failing there, the British
generals vainly tried to get control of the Hudson
River and the Middle States.</p>

<p>Their attention was now turned to the South, where
there were many Tories who would give material support
to the King's forces. George the Third had
great hopes of conquering all the Southern States, and
holding them at the end of the struggle as English
territory, even though the Americans should succeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in keeping possession of New England and the Middle
States.</p>

<p>Beginning in Georgia in 1778, the British captured
Savannah, but not until 1780 did they undertake the
serious business of conquering the South. In May of
that year General Lincoln, the American commander
of the Southern army, surrendered his entire force at
Charleston, and in the following August, General
Gates, at the head of a second American army, suffered
a crushing defeat in the battle of Camden. The
outlook for the patriot cause appeared dark. One
thing was certain. An able military leader must take
charge of the Americans, or the British would soon
overcome all opposition. Washington had great faith
in General Greene's ability, and without hesitation
selected him for this important task.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Greene was born in Warwick, R. I., in
1742. His father, a Quaker preacher on Sundays
and a blacksmith and miller on week days, brought up
his son in the strictest Quaker principles, and trained
him to work in the field, in the mill, and at the forge.
Nathaniel was robust and athletic, a leader in outdoor
sports. From an early age he was studious in his
habits, and in his manhood, when the troubles with
England seemed to threaten war, he eagerly turned his
attention to the study of military tactics.</p>

<img src="images/illus228.jpg" width="600" height="751" alt="Map Showing the War in the South." title="" />
<span class="caption">Map Showing the War in the South.</span>
</div>

<p>In 1774 Greene took an active part in organizing,
in Rhode Island, a military company called the Kentish
Guards, in which he at once enrolled himself as a
private. In order to procure a musket it was neces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>sary
for him to make a trip to Boston where, in his
Quaker costume of drab-colored clothes and broad
brimmed hat, he was a picturesque and interested
observer of the British regulars taking their customary
drill. On his return
he brought
with him not only
a musket, which he
concealed under
some straw in his
wagon, but also a
British deserter to
drill his company.</p>

<p>On the news of
the battle of Bunker
Hill a brigade of
three regiments was
raised in Rhode
Island, and Greene
was placed at its
head with the rank
of brigadier-general. With this brigade he at once
marched to Boston, and when Washington arrived to
take command of the American troops, General Greene
had the honor of welcoming him in behalf of the army.</p>

<p>At this time Greene was thirty-three years old, six
feet tall, with a strong, vigorous body and a frank,
intelligent face. He speedily won the friendship and
confidence of Washington, who afterward placed him
in positions of great responsibility. Throughout the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
entire war General Greene was actively engaged, and in
all his campaigns he showed remarkable energy and
promptness. It was natural that a general so able
should be sought in 1780 as commander of the American
army in the South.</p>

<p>When General Greene reached the Carolinas (December
2, 1780), he found the army in a forlorn condition.
There was but one blanket for every three soldiers,
and there were not enough provisions in camp to last
three days. The men were disheartened because
they had suffered defeat, rebellious because they were
unpaid, and sick because they were unfed. They
camped in rude huts made of fence rails, corn-stalks,
and brushwood.</p>

<p>But by his masterly way of doing things Greene
soon inspired the confidence of officers and soldiers
alike. A story is told that well illustrates the faith
his men had in their general. Once he saw a bare-footed
sentry and said to him, "How you must suffer
from cold!" "I do not complain," the sentry answered,
not aware that he was addressing his commander.
"I know I should fare well if our general
could procure supplies."</p>

<p>Not long after taking command of the army he sent
General Morgan with 900 picked men toward the
mountains in the Carolinas to threaten the British posts
there, while he himself, with the remainder of the army,
took a position nearer the coast on the Pedee River.
General Cornwallis, in command of the British army in
the South, detached Tarleton to march against Morgan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Early on the morning of January 17, 1781, after a
hard night march, Tarleton, over-confident of success,
attacked Morgan at Cowpens. But the Americans
repelled the attack with vigor and won a brilliant victory.
The British lost 230 killed
and wounded and 600 prisoners,
almost their entire force.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus230.jpg" width="336" height="448" alt="Lord Cornwallis." title="" />
<span class="caption">Lord Cornwallis.</span>
</div>

<p>Cornwallis was deeply chagrined,
for he had expected that
Tarleton would crush the American
force. He now planned to
march rapidly across the country
and defeat Morgan before
Greene's army could unite with
him. But Morgan, feeling certain
that Cornwallis would make
a strenuous effort to overwhelm him and rescue the
600 prisoners, marched with all possible speed in a
northeasterly direction, with the purpose of crossing
the Catawba River before Cornwallis could overtake
him.</p>

<p>Moreover, when Greene heard the glorious news of
the American victory, he knew that there was great
danger that Morgan's force would fall into the hands
of Cornwallis. He therefore planned not only to prevent
such a catastrophe, but also to lead Cornwallis far
away from his base of supplies at Wilmington on the
coast, to a place where his own force united with
Morgan's might fight a winning battle.</p>

<p>With these plans in mind, having ordered General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Huger to march rapidly with the army in a northerly
direction, Greene himself, with a small guard, swiftly
rode a distance of 150 miles across the rough country
to Morgan's army. On the last day of January he
reached it in the Catawba Valley, and began to direct
its movements.</p>

<p>In the meantime Cornwallis, with desperate energy,
was pressing in pursuit. For the next ten days it was
a race for life, with the odds in favor of Cornwallis.
But Greene was exceedingly alert and masterful. The
Catawba had been safely crossed, but Cornwallis
might overtake the Americans before they could cross
the Yadkin. To make all possible provision for a
speedy crossing, Greene sent men ahead to see that
boats should be collected on this river, ready for use
when he should need them. He also had the fore-thought
to carry with his army boats mounted on
wheels. When crossing a river these boats would
carry the wheels, and in advancing across the country
the wheels would carry the boats.</p>

<p>Having taken these precautions, Greene sent Morgan
forward toward Salisbury, while he himself waited
for a force of militia that was to guard fords on the
Catawba in order to delay Cornwallis. But while waiting
he heard that the militia had been scattered. When
this unfortunate news reached him, he started upon a
solitary ride through the heavy mud and drenching rain
in search of Morgan's force. When Greene alighted
at the Salisbury Inn, which had been turned into a
hospital for the soldiers, the army physician greeted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
him, asking how he was. "Fatigued, hungry, alone,
and penniless," he answered. The landlady, Mrs.
Elizabeth Steele, on hearing the reply, brought out
two bags of money, the savings of many a hard day's
labor. She said, "Take these, you will need them,
and I can do without them."</p>

<p>In this famous retreat of 200 miles through the
Carolinas the Americans forded three rivers, whose
waters, swollen by recent rains soon after the Americans
had crossed, checked the British in their pursuit.
Greene crossed the last of these rivers, the Dan, with
the two parts of his army now united, just in time to
escape Cornwallis.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus233.jpg" width="336" height="372" alt="General Francis Marion." title="" />
<span class="caption">General Francis Marion.</span>
</div>

<p>In all this time of trial and uncertainty General
Greene received valuable aid from partisan leaders in
the South. One of the most noted of these was Francis
Marion, who was born near Georgetown, S.C., in
1732. Although as a child, he was extremely delicate,
he grew strong after his twelfth year. In his mature
years he was short and slight in frame, but strong and
hardy in constitution.</p>

<p>When the British began to swarm into South Carolina
he raised and drilled a company of his neighbors
and friends known as "Marion's Brigade." These
men, without uniforms, without tents, and without
pay, were among the bravest and best of the Revolutionary
soldiers. Old saws beaten at the country
forge furnished them with sabres, and pewter mugs
and dishes supplied material for bullets. The diet of
these men was simple. Marion, their leader, usually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
ate hominy and potatoes, and drank water flavored
with a little vinegar.</p>

<p>The story is told that one day a British officer
entered the camp with a flag of truce. After the conference,
Marion, with his usual delicate
courtesy, invited him to dinner.
We may imagine the officer's surprise
when, seated at a log used for
a table, they were served to a dinner
consisting of roasted sweet potatoes
handed to them on pieces of bark.
The British officer was still more
surprised to learn that at times Marion's men were not
fortunate enough to have even potatoes.</p>

<p>"Marion's Brigade" of farmers and hunters seldom
numbered more than seventy, and often less than
twenty. With this very small force he annoyed the
British beyond measure by rescuing prisoners and by
capturing supply-trains, foraging parties, and outposts.
One day a scout brought in the report that a party of
ninety British with 200 prisoners were on the march
for Charleston. Waiting for the darkness to conceal
his movements, Marion with thirty men sallied out,
swooped down upon the British camp, captured, the
entire force, and rescued all the American prisoners.</p>

<p>It was the custom of Marion's men when hard
pressed by a superior force to scatter, each one for
himself, and, dashing headlong into the dense, dark
swamps, to meet again at the well-known hiding-place.
Even while the British were in search of them they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
sometimes darted out just as suddenly as they had
disappeared, and surprised another British party near
at hand. Well did Marion deserve the name of
"Swamp Fox," given him by the British.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 634px;">

<span class="caption">Marion and His Men Swooping Down on a British Camp.</span>
</div>

<p>With the aid of such partisan leaders, and by the
skilful handling of his army, Greene was more than a
match for Cornwallis. On receiving reinforcements
from Virginia Greene turned upon his enemy at Guilford
Court House, N. C., where he fought a losing
battle. But although defeated, he so crippled the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
British army that Cornwallis was obliged to retreat to
the coast to get supplies for his half-famished men
before marching northward into Virginia. In this long
and trying campaign Greene had completely outwitted
Cornwallis.</p>

<p>At the close of the war, as he passed through Philadelphia
on his way home, the people received him
with great enthusiasm. In 1785 he moved with his
family to a plantation which the State of Georgia had
given him. Here he lived in quiet and happiness less
than a year, when he died of sunstroke at the age of
forty-four. His comrade, Wayne, who was with him
at the time of his death, said of him: "He was great
as a soldier, great as a citizen, immaculate as a friend.... I
have seen a great and good man die."</p>

almost entirely between the Alleghany Mountains and
the Atlantic Ocean. Such continued to be their narrow
boundaries up to the beginning of the Revolutionary
War. To understand how, at the end of this
war, the western boundary had been extended to the
Mississippi, we must turn our attention to those early
western pioneers, the backwoodsmen, who rendered
very important services to their country.</p>

<p>One of the most noted of these pioneers was Daniel
Boone. He was born in Bucks County, Pa., in 1735.
Caring little for books, he spent most of his time in
hunting and fishing. The woods were his special delight,
and naturally he became an expert rifleman.</p>

<p>The story is told that when a small boy he wandered
one day into the forest some distance from home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and built himself a rough shelter of logs. There he
would spend days at a time with only his rifle and
game for company. The rifle served to bring down
the game, and this he cooked over a fire of logs. A
prince might have envied his dreamless slumber as he
lay on a bed of leaves with the skin of a wild animal
for covering. This free, wild life trained him for his
future career as a fearless hunter and woodsman.</p>

<p>When Daniel was about thirteen years old his
father moved to North Carolina and settled on the
Yadkin River, where Daniel grew to manhood. After
his marriage at the age of twenty, he built him a hut
in the solitude of the wilderness, far removed from
other settlers' homes.</p>

<span class="caption">Indian Costume (Female).</span>
</div>

<p>But Boone was restless. For years he looked with
eager eyes toward the rugged mountains on the west
and to the country beyond. Day by day, his desire to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
visit this wild unknown region increased, until he could
no longer restrain it. By the time he was twenty-five
he had begun his explorations and had pushed his way
as far as Boone's Creek, which is a branch of the Watauga
River in Eastern Tennessee.
Near this creek there yet stands a
beech-tree with the inscription: "D.
Boon cilled a bar on (this) tree in
the year 1760."</p>

<p>Nine years after this date Daniel
Boone, in company with five other
men, started out on May 1st to
cross the Alleghany Mountains.
For five weeks the bold travellers
picked their way through the pathless
woods. But when in June they
reached Kentucky, they were rewarded
for all the hardships they
had endured. For here was a beautiful
country with an abundance of
game, including deer, bears, and great herds of bison.</p>

<p>They promptly put up a shelter made of logs and
open on one side. The floor of this camp, as it was
called, was the earth, covered with leaves and hemlock
twigs.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 275px;">
<img src="images/illus240.jpg" width="275" height="640" alt="Indian Costume (Male)." title="" />
<span class="caption">Indian Costume (Male).</span>
</div>

<p>Six months after their arrival Boone and a man
named Stewart had an unpleasant experience. While
off on a hunting expedition, they were captured by an
Indian party. For seven days the dusky warriors carefully
guarded their prisoners. But on the seventh night,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
having gorged themselves with the game killed during
the day, the Indians fell into a sound sleep. Boone,
while pretending to be asleep, had been watching his
opportunity. So when the right moment came he quietly
arose, awoke Stewart, and the two
crept stealthily away until out of hearing
of the Indians. Then, leaping to
their feet, they bounded away like
deer, through the dark woods toward
their camp. This they found deserted,
and what had become of their
friends they never learned.</p>

<p>Some weeks later Boone was pleasantly
surprised by the appearance at
the camp of his brother, Squire Boone,
and a companion. The four men
lived together without special incident,
until one day Stewart was surprised
and shot by some Indians. Stewart's
death so terrified the man who had
accompanied Squire Boone, that he gave up the wilderness
life and returned to his home.</p>

<p>Boone and his brother remained together in the
forest for three months longer, but their ammunition
getting low, on May 1st Squire Boone returned to
North Carolina for a fresh supply and for horses.
Daniel was thus left alone, 500 miles from home.
His life was in constant peril from wild beasts and
Indians. He dared not sleep in his camp, but resorted
at night to a canebrake or some other hiding-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>place,
where he lay concealed, not even kindling a
fire lest its light might betray him. During these
months of solitary waiting for his brother, Boone
endured many privations. He had neither salt, sugar,
nor flour, his sole food being game brought down by
his rifle. But the return of his brother, in July, with
the expected provisions, brought him much good cheer.</p>

<p>After two years of this experience in the wilderness,
Daniel Boone returned to his home on the Yadkin
to make preparations for removal. By September,
1773, he had sold his farm and was ready to go with
his family to settle in Kentucky. His enthusiastic
reports of the fertile country he had been exploring
found eager listeners, and when his party was ready
to start it included, besides his wife and children, five
families and forty men, with a sufficient number of
horses and cattle. Unhappily they were attacked on
their way by Indians, and six men, one of them Boone's
eldest son, were killed. Discouraged by this setback
the party returned to the nearest settlement, and for
a while longer the migration westward was postponed.</p>

<p>But it was Boone's unflinching purpose to settle in
the beautiful Kentucky region. It had already become
historic, for the Indians called it a "dark
ground," a "bloody ground," and an old Indian Chief
had related to Boone how many tribes had hunted and
fought on its disputed territory.</p>

<p>None of the Indians held an undisputed claim to
the land. Nevertheless a friend of Boone, Richard
Henderson, and other white men made treaties with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
the powerful Cherokees, who allowed them to settle
here. As soon as it became certain that the Cherokees
would not interfere, Henderson sent Boone in charge
of thirty men to open a pathway from the Holston
River, over Cumberland Gap to the Kentucky River.
This is still known as the Wilderness Road, along
which so many thousand settlers afterward made their
way.</p>

<p>On reaching the Kentucky River, Boone and his
men set to work to build a fort on the left bank of
the stream. This fort they called Boonesborough. Its
four stout walls consisted in part of the outer sides of
log cabins and in part of a stockade, some twelve feet
high, made by thrusting into the ground stout pieces
of timber pointed at the top. There were loop-holes
in all the cabins, and a loop-holed block-house at each
corner of the fort.</p>

<p>Daniel Boone, the leader of this settlement, was a
man of interesting personality. He was a tall, slender
backwoodsman, with muscles of iron and a rugged
nature that enabled him to endure great hardship.
Quiet and serious, he possessed courage that never
shrank in the face of danger. Men had confidence in
him because he had confidence in himself. Moreover,
his kind heart and tender sympathies won lasting friendships.
He usually though not always dressed like an
Indian. A fur cap, a fringed hunting shirt, and leggings
and moccasins, all made of skins of wild animals,
made up his ordinary costume.</p>

<span class="caption">Daniel Boone in his Cabin.</span>
</div>

<p>If we should go in imagination into Daniel Boone's
log cabin out in the clearing not far from the fort, we
should find it a simple home with rude furnishings.
A ladder against the wall was the stairway by which
the children reached the loft. Pegs driven into the
wall held the scanty family wardrobe, and upon a
rough board, supported by four wooden legs, was
spread the family meal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/illus244.jpg" width="325" height="448" alt="A Hand Corn Mill." title="" />
<span class="caption">A Hand Corn Mill.</span>
</div>

<p>There was an abundance of plain and simple food.
Bear's meat was a substitute for pork, and venison for
beef. As salt was scarce, the beef was not salted down
or pickled, but was jerked by drying in the sun or
smoking over the fire. Corn was also an important
article of diet. When away
from home to hunt game or to
follow the war trail, sometimes
the only food which the settler
had was the parched corn he
carried in his pocket or wallet.
Every cabin had its hand-mill
for grinding the corn into meal
and a mortar for beating it
into hominy. The mortar was
made by burning a hole into
the top of a block of wood.</p>

<p>A pioneer boy found his life
a busy and interesting one. While still young he
received careful training in imitating the notes and
calls of birds and wild animals. He learned how
to set traps, and how to shoot a rifle with unerring
aim. At twelve years of age he became a
fort-soldier, with port-hole assigned to him for use
in case of an Indian attack. He received careful
training, also, in following an Indian trail and in
concealing his own when on the warpath. For expert
knowledge of this kind was necessary in the
midst of dangers from unseen foes that were likely
to creep stealthily upon the settlers at all times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
whether they were working in the clearings or hunting
in the forest.</p>

<p>After building the fort, Boone returned to his home
in North Carolina for his family. Some months after
the family reached Boonesborough, Boone's daughter
with two girl friends was one day floating in a boat
near the river-bank. Suddenly five Indians darted out
of the woods and, seizing the three girls, hurried away
with them. When in their flight the Indians observed
the eldest of the girls breaking twigs and dropping
them in their trail, they threatened to tomahawk her
unless she stopped it. But watching her chance, she
from time to time tore off strips of her dress, and
dropped them as guides to the pursuing whites.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus246.jpg" width="336" height="441" alt="A Wigwam." title="" />
<span class="caption">A Wigwam.</span>
</div>

<p>As soon as possible after hearing of the capture
Boone, with seven other men from the fort, started
upon the trail of the Indians and kept up the pursuit
until, early on the second morning, they discovered
the Indians sitting around a fire cooking breakfast.
Suddenly the whites, firing a volley, killed two of the
Indians and frightened the others so badly that they
beat a hasty retreat, leaving the girls uninjured.</p>

<p>Early in 1778, Boone and twenty nine other men
were captured and carried off by a party of Indian
warriors. At that time the Indians in that part of the
country were fighting on the English side in the
Revolution, and as they received a ransom for any
Americans they might hand over to the English, they
took Boone and the other men of his party to Detroit.</p>

<p>Although the English offered $500 for Boone's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
ransom the Indians refused to let him go. They
admired him so much that they took him to their
home, and with due ceremony adopted him into their
tribe. Having plucked out all his hair except a tuft
on the top of his head, they
dressed this with feathers and
ribbons as a scalp-lock. Next
they threw him into the river
and gave his body a thorough
scrubbing in order to wash out
all the white blood. Then, daubing
his face with paint in true
Indian fashion, they looked upon
him with huge satisfaction as one
of themselves.</p>

<p>Boone remained with them
several months, during which he made the best of the
life he had to lead. But when he heard that the
Indians were planning an attack upon Boonesborough,
he determined to escape if possible and give his friends
warning. His own words tell the story in a simple
way: "On the 16th of June, before sunrise, I departed
in the most secret manner, and arrived at
Boonesborough on the 20th after a journey of 160
miles, during which I had but one meal." He could
not get any food because he dared not use his gun,
nor would he build a fire for fear of discovery by his
foes. He reached the fort in safety, where he was of
great service in beating off the attacking party.</p>

<p>But this is only one of the many hairbreadth escapes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of the fearless backwoodsman. Once while in a shed
looking after some tobacco, four Indians with loaded
guns appeared at the door. They said: "Now, Boone,
we got you. You no get away any more. You no
cheat us any more." In the meantime, Boone had
gathered up in his arms a number of dry tobacco
leaves, and with the dust of these suddenly filled the
Indians' eyes and nostrils. Then while they were
coughing, sneezing, and rubbing their eyes, he made
good his escape.</p>

<span class="caption">Indian Implements</span>
</div>

<p>But from all his dangerous adventures Boone came
out safely, and for years remained the leader of the
settlement at Boonesborough. He was certainly a
masterful leader in that early pioneer life in Kentucky.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
The solitude of the wilderness never lost its charm for
him even to the last of his long life. He died in
1820, eighty-five years old. It has been said that but
for him the settlement in Kentucky could not have
been made for many years.</p>

<p>Through the achievements of early pioneers
and settlers, of whom Daniel Boone is the type,
the region lying between the Alleghany Mountains and
the Mississippi River came into the possession of the
United States. In a very different way did the territory
lying between the Mississippi River and the
Rocky Mountains become a part of the national domain.
It was acquired not by exploration or settlement,
but by purchase, and the man most intimately
associated with this purchase was Thomas Jefferson.</p>

<p>He was born in 1743 near Charlottesville, Va.,
on a plantation of nearly 2,000 acres. From his father,
a man of great physical strength and energy, Thomas
inherited a hardy constitution. As a boy he lived
an out-of-door life, sometimes hunting for deer, wild
turkeys, and other game, sometimes swimming or
paddling his boat in the river near his home, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
sometimes riding one of his father's horses. A skilful
and a daring rider, he remained to the end of his long
life fond of a fine horse.</p>

<p>When he was five years of age he entered school,
and thus early began his life-long habit of reading and
study. Even in his younger boyhood days he was
known among his playmates for industry and thoroughness.</p>

<p>At seventeen he entered William and Mary College,
at Williamsburg, Va. Although Williamsburg
was a village of only 1,000 people, it was the State
capital, and represented the most aristocratic and refined
social life of the colony. As a young college
student Jefferson received the full advantage of this
good society, and at the same time studied very hard,
sometimes as much as fifteen hours a day. But for his
strong body and sound health he must have broken
down under such a severe strain.</p>

<p>Being simple, refined, and gentle in manner, with a
cheerful disposition and rare intelligence, he easily
won and kept warm friends. One of these was the
rollicking, fun-loving Patrick Henry, who with his
jokes and stories kept everyone about him in good
humor. He and Jefferson were, in their youth, the
best of friends, and spent many an hour in playing
their violins together.</p>

<p>While in college at Williamsburg Jefferson, according
to a description left of him as he appeared at that
time, was six feet two and one-half inches tall, with a
slender frame, a freckled face, sandy hair, hazel-gray<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
eyes, and large feet and hands. He stood erect,
straight as an arrow, a perfect picture of health and
vigorous young manhood.</p>

<p>It was during the last of his five-year stay at Williamsburg
that Jefferson, then twenty-two-years old,
stood one day at the door of the court-house earnestly
listening to his friend Patrick Henry as he delivered
his famous speech. The impassioned words of the
great orator, bitterly denouncing the Stamp Act, made
a deep impression upon young Jefferson's fervid nature.
They fell as seed in good soil, and a few years
later yielded harvest in the cause of liberty.</p>

<p>These two men, devoted friends as they were, had
many traits in common. Both were earnest patriots and
fought in the same cause. But unlike Patrick Henry
Thomas Jefferson was a poor speaker. His power
expressed itself rather through his writing, and with
such grace and strength that he has rightly been called
"The Pen of the Revolution."</p>

<p>At twenty-nine years of age he married a beautiful
young widow of twenty-three. After the wedding
festivities, he and his bride started out in a four-horse
carriage to drive to his home, Monticello, more than
100 miles away. It was in the month of January,
and a heavy snow-storm overtook them, compelling
them to abandon the carriage and continue the journey
over the rough mountain roads on horseback.</p>

<p>When at last they reached Monticello, tired and
hungry, it was so late that the slaves had gone to
their quarters for the night. The house was dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
and the fires all out, but the bride and groom quickly
kindled a fire, hunted up refreshments, and made the
empty rooms ring with their songs and merriment.
Thus with joyous hearts did they begin a long-continued
and happy
married life in their
beautiful home, Monticello.</p>

<p>Both Jefferson and
his wife inherited
wealth. When he was
married, he owned
5,000 acres of land
and fifty-two slaves,
and a year later his wife's father died and left her
40,000 acres of land and 135 slaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 626px;">
<img src="images/illus252.jpg" width="626" height="480" alt="Monticello." title="" />
<span class="caption">Monticello.</span>
</div>

<p>He became strongly attached to his mountain home
and his life there as a planter, taking great interest in
laying out and cultivating the grounds, and in introducing
many new varieties of plants and trees.</p>

<p>But he was too public-spirited to be lost in his private
interest. In the year following his marriage, the
famous "Boston Tea Party" emptied the chests of
taxed tea into Boston Harbor. Then followed such
stirring events as the Boston Port Bill, the first meeting
of the Continental Congress, and the battles of
Lexington and Concord; and finally the crisis, when
the brave men of the Continental Congress, having decided
that the time had come for the American people
to declare themselves free and independent of Eng<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>land,
appointed a committee of five to draw up the
Declaration of Independence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 535px;">
<img src="images/illus253.jpg" width="535" height="800" alt="THOMAS JEFFERSON AT WORK UPON THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE." title="" />
<span class="caption">THOMAS JEFFERSON AT WORK UPON THE FIRST DRAFT OF THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Jefferson was one of this committee and, as he had
distinguished himself for literary ability, it fell to him
to write the first draft of this great state paper. Congress
spent a few days in making some unimportant
changes in Jefferson's draft, but left it practically as he
had written it. On July 4, 1776, all the members of
the Continental Congress signed the Declaration of Independence
in Carpenter's Hall, Philadelphia, a hall
which is yet standing.</p>

<p>One of the striking things that Jefferson wrote in
the Declaration of Independence was that "all men are
created equal." He was always democratic in feeling,
trying to do what he could for the interest of rich and
poor alike. There was a law in Virginia requiring that
the owner of land should hand it down to his eldest
son. In its place he got a law passed which would
permit all the children of a family to share in the land
owned by their father. Another law in Virginia required
that people should pay taxes for the support of
the religious denomination, or church, known as the
Established Church. As Jefferson believed this law
unfair, he secured the passage of one which provided
that nobody should be compelled to pay taxes for the
support of any church.</p>

<p>But Jefferson showed his sympathy for the rights of
others quite as much in his private as in his public life,
and won the personal attachment of his numerous
household. His letters to his little daughters were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
full of loving advice, and their letters to him breathed
the spirit of genuine affection. When, after the close
of the Revolution, Franklin returned from his mission
as minister to France, Jefferson was sent to take his
place. On his return to Monticello at the end of five
years, his slaves went miles to meet him and give him
a hearty welcome home. They wished to take the
horses from the carriage, that they might draw it themselves;
and when, arriving at the house, Jefferson
alighted, they bore him proudly upon their shoulders,
while they laughed and cried for joy because "Massa"
had come home again.</p>

<p>Jefferson was truly polite, because he had warm
sympathy for others, especially for the poor and
the needy. Once when he and his grandson were
out riding together they met a negro who bowed
to them. The young man paid no attention to the
negro, but Jefferson politely returned the bow, saying,
"Do you permit a negro to be more of a gentleman
than yourself?" thus teaching the young man a useful
lesson.</p>

<p>After filling many of the highest offices in the country,
Thomas Jefferson became the third President of
the United States in 1801. He had looked on with
serious misgivings at some of the ceremonies and formalities
in the executive mansion while Washington
was President. He loved Washington, but he did not
think that the President of the United States should
be coldly formal and hold himself aloof from the people
quite as much as Washington did. He believed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
"republican simplicity," which he began to practise on
the very day he was inaugurated.</p>

<p>On that occasion he went on foot to the capitol,
clothed in his every-day dress, and attended by some
of his political friends. It became his custom later
when going up to the capitol on official business to
ride on a horse, which he tied with his own hands to
a fence near by, before entering. He declined to hold
weekly levees, as had been the custom, but instead
opened his house to all on the fourth of July and
the first of January. In these ways he was carrying
out his convictions that the President should be simple
in dress and manner, or, in other words, should
live in "republican simplicity."</p>

<p>Many acts of Jefferson prove that he was an able
statesman; but one of the greatest things he did, while
President in the years 1801-1809, was the purchase of
Louisiana. Do not think of this territory as the State
of Louisiana. It was far more than this, for it included
all the country lying between the Mississippi
River on the east and the Rocky Mountains on the west,
and extending from Canada on the north to Texas on
the south.</p>

<p>In 1763, at the close of the Last French War,
France gave up all this vast region to Spain. But in
1800, Napoleon forced Spain to give it up to France.
When the Americans learned that Louisiana had again
become French territory they were alarmed, as the
country that held Louisiana could control the mouth
of the Mississippi, and stop all American goods pass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>ing
down through the river. As a consequence,
American settlers living west of the Alleghanies would
not be able to find a ready outlet to the world for their
products. Then, too, France might plant a strong
colony in Louisiana and thus give the American people
untold trouble.</p>

<p>Accordingly, President Jefferson sent Monroe to
France to aid in securing New Orleans and a stretch
of territory in Louisiana lying on the east bank of the
Mississippi. By getting that territory, the Americans
would own the entire east bank of the river, and could
therefore control their own trade.</p>

<p>The Americans approached Napoleon at a fortunate
time; for he was greatly in need of money to aid him
in his war with England. Besides, he feared that
England might seize Louisiana with her fleet. He
therefore gladly sold us for $15,000,000 all the immense
territory of Louisiana.</p>

<p>By carefully looking at your map you will get some
idea of its vast extent. It was much larger than all the
rest of the territory which we held before this purchase
was made. Jefferson himself, perhaps, hardly realized
how great a thing he was doing for his country when
he made the purchase.</p>

<p>At the end of his term of office as President, Jefferson
retired to private life in his much-loved home of
Monticello. Famous not only for his statesmanship,
but for his learning, he was called the "Sage of Monticello,"
and was visited by people from far and near.
The number of his guests was enormous, his house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>keepers
sometimes finding it necessary to provide fifty
beds for them.</p>

<p>Of course all this entertaining was a great burden,
and the expense of it almost ruined him financially.
But his life moved happily on. Always busy with
some useful work, he took a deep interest in education,
and was the founder of the University of Virginia,
in which he felt a just pride.</p>

<p>On July 4, 1826, just fifty years after the signing
of the Declaration of Independence, this great man
breathed his last, at the ripe age of eighty-three.
On the tombstone which marks his grave at Monticello
is this inscription, written by his own hand:
"Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the
Declaration of Independence, of the Statutes of Virginia
for Religious Freedom, and Father of the
University of Virginia." It was such things as these&mdash;things
that touched the freedom of all men&mdash;that
he sought to further, and in so doing found his
greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>After the purchase of Louisiana thousands of
settlers joined the ever-swelling tide of westward
migration which had been set in motion by the
early pioneers. These frontiersmen had made their
way across the mountains either by the forest trail,
leading with them their pack-horses or, a little later,
by the rough road cut through the forest, their household
goods packed in a strong wagon drawn by oxen
or horses.</p>

<p>Already this difficult method had given place to the
flat boat, which, though safer and more convenient,
was still unsatisfactory except when it floated down
stream. In the early years of this century, therefore,
the increasing demands of migration and traffic turned
many inventive minds to the problem of applying
steam-power to river navigation, in the hope of accomplishing
a speedier means of travel and transpor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>tation.
The first to achieve success in inventing and
bringing into practical use a steam-driven boat was
Robert Fulton.</p>

<p>Robert Fulton was born of poor parents in 1765,
in Little Britain, Pa. His father having died when
the boy was only three years old, his mother took
charge of his education. She taught him herself until
he was eight and then sent him to school. But he
had no liking for books, and made slow progress.
Drawing and mechanical devices absorbed his interest,
and nothing gave him greater delight than to visit the
shops of mechanics and there with his own hands to
work out his new ideas.</p>

<p>It is said that Robert came into school late one
morning, and upon being reproved by his teacher
explained that he had been
at a shop beating a piece
of lead into a pencil. At
the same time he exhibited
the pencil and remarked:
"It is the best
that I have ever used."
Upon examining it the
school-master was so well
pleased that he praised
Robert's effort, and in a short time nearly all the
pupils were using the same sort of pencil.</p>

<p>His ingenious ideas found expression in other ways.
For example, it was the custom of his town to celebrate
the Fourth of July by an illumination with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
candles; but one year candles being scarce, the citizens
were requested to omit the usual display. Robert
was at this time only thirteen years old, and like other
boys of his age, full of Fourth of July patriotism
which had to be expressed
in some extraordinary
way. So
he set his busy brain
to work, and having
bought gunpowder
and pasteboard, produced
some home-made sky-rockets which greatly
astonished the community by their mid-air explosions.
Such fireworks were at that time entirely new to the
people of the town.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/illus263.jpg" width="640" height="303" alt="A Flat Boat." title="" />
<span class="caption">A Flat Boat.</span>
</div>

<p>Another illustration of his inventive gift belongs to
his boyhood days. He and one of his playmates used
to go out fishing in a flat boat which they propelled
by the use of long poles. Getting tired of this method
of navigation, Robert made two crude paddle-wheels,
one for each side of the boat, connecting them
by a sort of double crank, which the boys united
in turning. They could then easily propel the boat
in their fishing trips to various parts of the lake,
and keenly enjoyed this novel and easy way of going
a-fishing.</p>

<p>While still young Robert won the warm regard of
a great painter, Benjamin West, whose father was an
intimate friend of Robert's father. Very likely this
friendship turned Robert's mind strongly toward paint<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>ing.
At all events, the desire to become an artist
took so strong a hold upon him that at the age of
seventeen he went to Philadelphia and devoted his
time to drawing and painting. Here he remained
three years and painted with such skill that he not
only supported himself, but sent money to his old
home, and saved $400, with which he bought a little
home for his mother.</p>

<p>In time his interest in art led him to go to London,
where he studied under Benjamin West. But very
soon he became interested in trying to improve canal
navigation and in working out various mechanical appliances.</p>

<p>This love for invention finally diverted his attention
very largely from painting, and led him to
the work which made him famous. When about
thirty years old he went to Paris to experiment with
a diving-boat, an invention of his own, intended to
carry cases of gunpowder under water. This machine
was not successful, but by the spring of 1801, a little
more than three years after his first effort, he had constructed
another diving-boat, and went with it to Brest
where he gave it a successful trial. With three companions
he descended twenty-five feet below the surface
of the water and remained for one hour. In 1805
he tested it again in England where, with a torpedo
of 170 pounds, he blew up a vessel of 200 tons.</p>

<p>For the invention of the torpedo-boat, the world
is indebted to Fulton, but for the first successful
steamboat it owes him a debt of deeper gratitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Before leaving Paris, Fulton became acquainted with
Robert R. Livingston, who was at that time the American
minister to France. Mr. Livingston had long felt
an interest in steamboat navigation, and was willing to
supply Fulton the necessary money. A steamboat,
constructed at Paris, was finished by the spring of
1803, and the day for its trial trip was at hand, when,
early one morning the boat broke in two parts and
sunk to the bottom of the river. The frame had been
too weak to support the weight of the heavy machinery.
On receiving the news, Fulton hastened to
the scene of his misfortune and began at once the work
of raising the boat. For twenty-four hours, without
food or rest, and standing up to his waist in the cold
water, he labored with his men until he succeeded in
raising the machinery and in placing it in another boat.
But the exposure to which he submitted himself
brought on a lung trouble from which he never fully
recovered.</p>

<p>Having discovered the defects of the machinery
Fulton returned in 1806 to America, where, with
money furnished by his friend Livingston, he began to
construct another steamboat which he called the Clermont,
after the name of Livingston's home on the
Hudson. This boat was 130 feet long and 18 feet
wide, with a mast and a sail, and on each side a wheel
15 feet in diameter, fully exposed to view.</p>

<p>One morning in August, 1807, a throng of expectant
people gathered on the banks of the North River
at New York, to see the trial of the Clermont. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>body
was looking for failure. People had all along
spoken of Fulton as a crack-brained dreamer, and had
called the Clermont "Fulton's Folly." "Of course
the thing would not move." "That any man with
common-sense might know,"
they said. So while Fulton
was waiting to give the signal
to start, these wiseacres were
getting ready to jest at his
failure.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/illus266.jpg" width="448" height="314" alt="The Clermont." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Clermont.</span>
</div>

<p>Finally, at the signal, the
Clermont moved slowly, and then stood perfectly still.
"Just what I have been saying," said one onlooker
with emphasis. "I knew the boat would not go,"
said another. "Such a thing is impossible," said a
third. But they spoke too soon, for after a little adjustment
of the machinery, the Clermont steamed
proudly up the Hudson.</p>

<p>As she continued her journey, all along the river,
people who had come from far and near stood watching
the strange sight. When the boatmen and sailors
on the Hudson, heard the clanking machinery and saw
the great sparks of fire and the volumes of dense,
black smoke rising out of the funnel, they thought the
Clermont was a sea-monster. In their superstitious
dread, some of them went ashore, some jumped into
the river, and some fell on their knees in fear, believing
the day of judgment to be at hand. One old
Dutchman told his wife that he had seen the devil coming
up the river on a raft.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>The trip of 150 miles from New York to Albany
was made in thirty-two hours. Success had at last rewarded
this man of strong common-sense, quiet modesty,
and iron will. The Clermont was the first steamboat
of practical use ever invented. From that time
men saw the immeasurable advantage to trade of steam
navigation on lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>This was Fulton's last work of great public interest.
He died in 1815, having rendered an untold service to
the industrial welfare of his country and the world.</p>

<p>Only four years after the Clermont made its successful
trip up the Hudson, the first steamboat
on the Ohio was launched at Pittsburg. This boat
was the forerunner of numerous steam-driven craft
which swarmed the extensive network of rivers west
of the Alleghany Mountains. A fresh impulse was
given to westward migration, for settlers could now
easily and cheaply reach the fertile lands of the
Mississippi Valley, and, having raised an abundant
crop, could successfully send the surplus to
the Eastern markets. Under conditions so favorable
the West grew in population with marvellous
rapidity.</p>

<p>Wealth went hand in hand with the increase of
population, and greatly strengthened the influence of
the people of the West in the affairs of the country.
By 1829, one of their number became the sixth Presi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>dent
of the United States. This was Andrew Jackson,
of Tennessee.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 448px;">
<img src="images/illus269.jpg" width="448" height="239" alt="Andrew Jackson's Cradle." title="" />
<span class="caption">Andrew Jackson's Cradle.</span>
</div>

<p>Andrew Jackson was born in Union County, N. C.,
in 1767, of poor parents, who about two years before
had come from Ireland. In a little clearing in the
woods, they had built a rude log hut and settled down
to hard work.</p>

<p>But Andrew's father soon died, and his mother
went with her children to live in her brother's home,
where she spun flax to earn money. She was very
fond of little Andrew and hoped some day to make a
minister of him. With this in view she sent him to
school where he learned reading, writing, and a little
ciphering. But he cared so little for study that he
made small advancement, and in fact never learned to
spell well nor to write the English language with ease
or even correctness.</p>

<p>He found great pleasure in hunting and in rough-and-tumble
sports, excelling in running, jumping, and
wrestling. Although not robust, he was wiry and
energetic, and when a
stronger boy threw him to
the ground, he was so
agile that he always managed
to regain his feet.</p>

<p>As a school-boy Andrew
was a bare-footed, freckle-faced lad, with slender frame,
bright blue eyes, and reddish colored hair. Full of
life and fun, he became known as "Mischievous
Andy." Andy was brave and ready to champion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
the weaker and smaller boys, but sometimes he became
overbearing and at other times his quick temper
got him into trouble. One day his companions,
wishing to play a practical joke upon him, secretly
overloaded a gun, and
dared Andy to shoot it.
The fearless little fellow,
seizing the gun, shot it
off, and was kicked violently
upon his back. But
quickly jumping up, his
eyes blazing with anger,
he shouted, "If any of
you boys laugh, I'll kill
him." The boys did not
laugh.</p>

<span class="caption">A Spinning Wheel.</span>
</div>

<p>While he was yet a lad the Revolution broke out,
and there was severe fighting between the Americans
and the British near his home. His love of action,
which up to that time had expressed itself in out-of-door
sports, now took a more serious turn. War
became a passion with him, and from this time he could
not visit the local blacksmith's shop without hammering
into shape some form of weapon. Once while
fiercely cutting weeds with a scythe he was heard repeating
these words: "Oh, if I were a man, how I
would sweep down the British with my grass blade!"</p>

<p>In the course of a few years young "Andy" had
real British soldiers to fight; for he was only thirteen
when he was made a prisoner of war. One day soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
after his capture, a British officer ordered him to clean
his muddy boots. The fiery youth flashed back: "Sir,
I am not your slave. I am your prisoner, and as
such I refuse to do the work of a slave." Incensed
at this reply, the brutal officer struck the boy a cruel
blow with his sword. Andrew saved himself from the
brunt of the blow, but received two severe wounds,
the scars and the bitter memory of which he carried
through life.</p>

<p>These indignities were but a beginning. He was
transferred to the prison pen about Camden jail, some
forty miles away, where without shelter and almost
without food, he suffered from heartless exposure. In
a weak and half-starved condition, his wounds yet unhealed,
he fell a victim to small-pox. Hearing of his
wretched plight, Andrew's mother secured his release
and took him home with her. Andrew struggled for
months with a severe illness. Before he had entirely
recovered, his mother died leaving him quite alone in
the world.</p>

<p>But these hardships passed, and some years later
Andrew decided to become a lawyer. After studying
law for a while, at twenty-one he crossed the mountains
with an emigrant party into the backwoods region
of Tennessee. Now grown to manhood, he was six
feet and one inch tall, slender, straight, and graceful,
with a long slim face and thick hair falling over a forehead
beneath which looked out piercing blue eyes.</p>

<p>When he reached Nashville, the destination of his
party, his experience was, in a large measure, the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
as that of Daniel Boone in the wilds of Kentucky.
When the women of the settlement went out to pick
berries, and when the men hoed corn in the clearings,
some of the settlers, gun in hand, with watchful eyes
stood guard against attack from stealthy Indians.</p>

<p>To the dangers belonging to backwoods life, Jackson
was greatly exposed. The court-houses in which,
as public prosecutor, he had to try cases, were in some
instances hundreds of miles apart. In going from
one to another he journeyed alone, and sometimes had
to remain alone in the woods for twenty nights in succession.
In periods of unusual danger, he dared not
light a fire or even shoot a deer for fear of Indians.</p>

<p>But in the midst of all these dangers he escaped
harm, and by his energy and business ability achieved
success as a lawyer. In time he acquired the means to
become a large land-owner. After his marriage he
built a house which he called The Hermitage, on a
plantation of 1,100 acres, about eleven miles from
Nashville.</p>

<p>Here Jackson lived with his wife, whom he loved
with a deep and abiding affection. They kept open
house for visitors, and entertained large numbers of
guests at a time, treating rich and poor with like hospitality.
His warm heart and generous nature were especially
shown in his own household, where he was
kind to all, including his slaves. Having no children
he adopted two, one of whom was an Indian baby-boy
who had lost his mother. Of these children, Jackson
was very fond.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Indeed, childlike simplicity was always one of his
striking traits. Not even when he became a noted
man did he give up smoking his corn-cob pipe. But
we must not think of him as a faultless man, for besides
being often rough in manner
and speech he had a
violent temper which got
him into many serious
troubles; among them were
some foolish duels.</p>

<p>After one of his duels,
with a ball in his shoulder
and his left arm in a sling,
he went to lead an army of
2,500 men in an attack
upon the Creek Indians,
who had risen against the
whites in Alabama. These Indians had captured
Fort Mimms, which was in Southern Alabama, about
forty miles north of Mobile, and had massacred 500
men, women, and children seeking shelter there. Although
Jackson was weak from a long illness, he
marched with vigor against the Creeks. In the campaign
he endured much hardship, increased by the
difficulty of feeding his 2,500 men in a wild country,
where they almost starved for lack of food.</p>

<p>Under such conditions Jackson had to exercise much
firmness and tact to keep his army from deserting and
returning home. The following incident is told to show
in what way he won the confidence and love of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
men: "A soldier, gaunt and woe-begone, approached
the general one morning, while he was sitting under a
tree eating, and begged for some food, as he was nearly
starving. 'It has always been a rule with me,' replied
Jackson, 'never to turn away a hungry man when it
was in my power to relieve him, and I will most cheerfully
divide with you what I have.' Putting his hand
into his pocket, he drew forth a few acorns, saying:
'This is the best and only fare that I have.'" But in
spite of all his drawbacks, Jackson conquered the
Creeks, and thus broke for all time the power of the
Indians south of the Ohio River.</p>

<p>Not long afterward he was sent at the head of an
army, with the rank of major-general, to defend New
Orleans against an attack of the British who hoped to
get control of the lower Mississippi and all the southern
part of what was then known as the Louisiana Territory.
When Jackson went down to New Orleans he
was in such extremely poor health that he was hardly
able to sit on his horse. Nevertheless he worked night
and day with unflagging energy, arming his men and encouraging
them to meet the over-confident British foe.</p>

<p>The British army consisted of 12,000 veterans fresh
from victories over the great Napoleon. Naturally
enough they despised the American backwoodsmen.
Their confidence seemed reasonable, for they numbered
twice as many as the Americans.</p>

<p>On January 8, 1815, the British made a vigorous
assault on the American lines. But they were mowed
down with such terrible slaughter that at the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
twenty-five minutes, they were forced to retreat with a
loss of 2,600 men in killed and wounded. The Americans
lost only twenty-one. The resolute courage and
unwearied action of "Old Hickory," as Jackson was
fondly called by his men, had won a signal victory.
Through his military reputation Jackson soon became
very popular. His honesty and patriotism took a
strong hold on the people, and in due time he was
elected President of the United States.</p>

<p>A man of passionate feeling, he loved his friends
and hated his enemies with equal intensity. Moreover,
he did not seem to think that a man could disagree
with him, especially in political matters, and still be
his friend. So when he became President he at once
began to turn out of office those who held government
positions, and put into their places men of his own
political party who had helped to bring about his election.
Thus was introduced into our national civil service
the "spoils system."</p>

<p>We can readily imagine that such a man, so warm-hearted,
and yet so intolerant, would make many
friends and many enemies. But no one doubted his
sincerity, especially in matters pertaining to the welfare
of his country. His absolute fairness and his high
sense of duty are well illustrated by his dealings with
the Nullification Act. By reason of a high tariff,
passed for the protection of manufacturers in the
North, South Carolina declared that she would not
allow any such law to be enforced in that State. This
declaration was called the Nullification Act.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackson himself did not favor a high tariff, but he
was firm in his purpose that whatever law Congress
passed should be enforced in every State in the Union.
When, therefore, he heard of the action of South Carolina,
he rose to the full height of his executive authority.
The news came to him as he was quietly smoking his
corn-cob pipe. In a flash of anger he cried aloud,
"The Union! It must and shall be preserved! Send
for General Scott!" Troops were speedily sent to
compel obedience, and South Carolina withdrew her
opposition.</p>

<p>In 1837, at the end of his term of office as President
of the United States, he went to his old home, The
Hermitage, where he once more took up the life of a
hospitable planter. He was now nearly seventy years
old, and a constant sufferer from disease. With his
usual stubborn will, however, he battled for several
years longer. He died in 1845, at the age of seventy-eight,
one of the most striking figures in American history.
His prompt and decisive action in compelling
South Carolina to obey the tariff laws did much to
strengthen the Union, for it prepared the nation to
ward off the greater danger of secession, in which South
Carolina took the lead, twenty-eight years later.</p>

<p>Andrew Jackson's stern rebuke of the
nullification movement was a timely one, for
there existed in the South a widespread feeling that
the Union was not supreme over the States. In the
North, on the contrary, the Union was regarded as
superior to the States and qualified to enforce any law
passed by Congress unless the Supreme Court should
declare such law unconstitutional. Which point of
view was correct? The answer to that momentous
question involved a long and bitter struggle between
the two parts of the Union. The great statesman
who set forth the northern view was Daniel Webster.</p>

<p>He was born among the hills of New Hampshire,
in Salisbury (now Franklin), in 1782, the son of a
poor farmer and the ninth of ten children.</p>

<p>As Daniel was a frail child, not able to work much
on the farm, his parents permitted him to spend much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
time in fishing, hunting, and roaming at will over the
hills. Thus he came into close touch with nature, and
gained much knowledge which was useful to him in
later years. It was his good fortune to have as a companion
on these out-door excursions an old English
soldier and sailor then living in a small house on the
Webster farm. The two friends, so far apart in age,
were good comrades, and were often seen walking together
along the streams. The old soldier entertained
his young listener with many thrilling tales of adventure
on land and sea, and the boy read to his friend
from books which the old man liked well.</p>

<p>Daniel's father had also been a soldier, having
served in Indian wars and in the Revolution, and related
many interesting experiences to his son. One
which always appealed to young Daniel was the account
of a meeting, years before, with General Washington
at the time when Arnold was found to be
a traitor. In this interview Washington had taken
Webster's hand and, looking seriously into his face,
had said, "Captain Webster, I believe I can trust
you." This expression of confidence by the general to
his subordinate stirred the boy's imagination.</p>

<p>In these ways did his patriotism receive a great
stimulus. An incident which occurred when he was
only eight years old illustrates the seriousness of his
mind. Having seen at a store near his home a small
cotton handkerchief with the Constitution of the
United States printed on it, he gathered up his small
earnings to the amount of twenty-five cents and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
eagerly secured the treasure. From this remarkable
copy he learned the Constitution word for word, so
that he could repeat it from beginning to end.</p>

<p>Of course this was an unusual thing for an eight-year-old
boy to do, but the boy himself was unusual.
He spent much of his time poring over books. They
were few in number, but of good quality, and he read
them over and over again until he made them a part
of himself. It was a pleasure to him to memorize
fine poems also, and noble selections from the Bible,
for he learned easily and remembered well what he
learned. In this way he stored his mind with the
highest kind of truth.</p>

<p>Naturally his father was proud of his boy and
longed to give him a good education. One day,
when Daniel was only thirteen years old, they were at
work together in the hay-field, when a college-bred
man, also a member of Congress, stopped to speak
with Mr. Webster. When the stranger had gone his
way Mr. Webster expressed to his son deep regret
that he himself was not an educated man, adding
that because of his lack of education he had to work
hard for a very small return.</p>

<p>"My dear father," said Daniel, "you shall not
work. Brother and I will work for you, and will wear
our hands out, and you shall rest." Then Daniel,
whose heart was tender and full of deep affection, cried
bitterly.</p>

<p>"My child," said Mr. Webster, "it is of no importance
to me. I now live but for my children. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
could not give your elder brothers the advantage of
knowledge, but I can do something for you. Exert
yourself, improve your opportunities, learn, learn, and
when I am gone you will not need to go through the
hardships which I have undergone, and which have
made me an old man before my time."</p>

<p>These words show the earnest purpose of the father.
The next year the boy, now fourteen, was sent to
Phillips Exeter Academy. The principal began Daniel's
examination by directing him to read a passage
in the Bible. The boy's voice was so rich and musical
and his reading so intelligent that he was allowed to
read the entire chapter and then admitted without
further questioning. This was only one illustration of
his marvellous power as a reader. Teamsters used to
stop at the home farm in order to hear that "Webster
boy," as they called Daniel, read or recite poetry or
verses of Scripture.</p>

<p>The boys he met at the academy were mostly from
homes of wealth and culture. Some of them were rude
and laughed at Daniel's plain dress and country manners.
Of course the poor boy, whose health was still
weak and who was by nature shy and independent,
found such treatment hard to bear.</p>

<p>But he studied well, and soon commanded respect
because of his high rank. One of his school duties,
however, he found impossible to perform, and that
was to stand before the school and declaim. He
would carefully memorize and practise his declamation,
but, when called on to speak, he could not rise from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
his seat and go upon the platform. During the nine
months of his stay in the academy, he failed to overcome
his deficiency in declaiming.</p>

<p>After leaving this school he studied for six months
under Dr. Woods, a private tutor, who prepared him
to enter Dartmouth, at the age of fifteen.</p>

<p>Although he proved himself to be a youth of great
mental power, he did not take high rank in scholarship.
But he continued to read widely and thoughtfully,
and acquired much valuable knowledge which he
used with great clearness and force in conversation or
debate. While in Dartmouth, he overcame his inability
as a declaimer, and gave striking evidence of the
oratorical power for which he afterward became so
famous.</p>

<p>After spending two years in Dartmouth, Daniel
begged his elder brother Ezekiel to join him there.
But Ezekiel was needed at home, for their father, who
was now sixty years old, was in poor health and had
even at that age to work hard to feed and clothe his
family. He had found it necessary to mortgage the
farm to send Daniel to college. How could he send
Ezekiel, too? It seemed foolish to think of doing so.
But when Daniel urged such a course and agreed to
help by teaching, the matter was arranged.</p>

<p>After graduation Daniel taught for a year and
earned the money he had promised Ezekiel. The
following year he studied law and in due time was
admitted to the bar. As a lawyer he was very successful,
his income sometimes amounting to $20,000<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
in a single year. But he could not manage his money
affairs well, and no matter how large his income he was
always in debt. This unfortunate state of affairs was
owing to a reckless extravagance, which he displayed
in many ways.</p>

<p>Indeed, Webster was a man of such large ideas that
of necessity he did all things on a large scale. It was
vastness that appealed to him. And this dominating
force in his nature explains his idea of nationality and
his opposition to State Rights. He was too large in
his views of life to limit himself to his State at the expense
of his country. To him the Union stood first
and the State second, and to make the Union great and
strong became a ruling passion in his life.</p>

<p>Webster's magnificent reach of thought and profound
reverence for the Union is best expressed in
his speeches. The most famous one is his brilliant
"Reply to Hayne."</p>

<p>Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, had delivered an
able speech, in which he put the authority of the State
before that of the Union, and said that the Constitution
supported that doctrine. Webster, then a senator
from Massachusetts, had but one night to prepare an
answer. But he knew the Constitution by heart, for
he had been a close student of it since the days of
childhood, when he had learned it from the cotton
handkerchief.</p>

<p>Senator Hayne's masterly speech caused many
people to question whether even Daniel Webster could
answer his arguments, and New England men espe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>cially,
fearing the dangerous doctrine of State Rights,
awaited anxiously the outcome. When, therefore, on
the morning of January 26, 1830, Mr. Webster entered
the Senate Chamber to utter that memorable
reply, he found a crowd of eager men and women
waiting to hear him.</p>

<p>"It is a critical moment," said a friend to Mr. Webster,
"and it is time, it is high time, that the people of
this country should know what this Constitution <i>is</i>."</p>

<p>"Then," said Webster, "by the blessing of Heaven
they shall learn, this day, before the sun goes down
what I understand it to be."</p>

<p>Nationality was Webster's theme, his sole purpose
being to strengthen the claims of the Union. For
four hours he held his audience spellbound while he
set forth with convincing logic the meaning of the Constitution.
The great orator won an overwhelming
victory. Not only were many of his hearers in the
Senate chamber that day convinced, but loyal Americans
all over the country were inspired with more
earnest devotion to the Union. His last words "Liberty
and Union! one and inseparable, now and forever"
electrified his countrymen and became a watchword
of national progress.</p>

<p>Webster's power as an orator was enhanced by his
remarkable physique. His striking personal appearance
made a deep impression upon everyone that saw
or heard him. One day when he was walking through
one of the streets of Liverpool a navvy said of him,
"There goes a king!" On another occasion Sydney<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
Smith exclaimed, "Good heavens! he is a small cathedral
by himself." He was nearly six feet tall. He had
a massive head, a broad, deep brow, and great coal-black
eyes, which once seen could never be forgotten.</p>

<span class="caption">Marshfield&mdash;Home of Daniel Webster.</span>
</div>

<p>To the day of his death he showed his deep affection
for the flag, the emblem of that Union which had inspired
his noblest efforts. During the last few weeks
of his life, troubled much with sleeplessness, he used
to watch the stars, and while thus occupied his eyes
would often fall upon a small boat of his which
floated in plain view of his window. On this boat he
had a ship lantern so placed that in the darkness he
could see the Stars and Stripes flying there. The flag
was raised at six in the evening and kept flying until
six in the morning to the day of Daniel Webster's
death, which took place in September, 1852. On
looking at the dead face a stranger said: "Daniel
Webster, the world without you will be lonesome."</p>

<p>Although we need not be blind to his faults, we may
indeed count him among the greatest of Americans.
For he did much to make the Union strong. He filled
many high positions and had a wonderful influence in
all the affairs of the nation.</p>

<p>Great as was the power of the steamboat and
the railroad in quickening the social life of mankind,
of still greater influence in binding together remote
communities was the invention of the electric telegraph.
The steamboat and the railroad made travel
and transportation easier, and frequent intercourse by
letters and newspapers possible; but the electric telegraph
enabled men to flash their thoughts thousands
of miles in a few seconds. The inventor of this wonderful
mechanism was Samuel Finley Breese Morse.</p>

<p>He was born, in 1791, in a house standing at the
foot of Breed's Hill, Charlestown, Mass. His father
was a learned minister who, as Daniel Webster said,
"was always thinking, always writing, always talking,
always acting"; and his mother a woman of noble
character, who inspired her son with manly purpose.</p>

<p>When Finley was only four years of age he was sent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
to a school kept by an elderly woman known as "Old
Ma'am Rand." She was lame, but nowise halting in
discipline, for she kept near at hand a long rattan stick
by means of which, when necessary, she could quickly
reach her pupils in any part of the room.</p>

<p>He did not remain long under "Old Ma'am
Rand's" tuition, for when he was seven he went to
school at Andover, and still later entered Phillips
Academy in the same town. At fourteen he entered
Yale College, where from the first he was a thoughtful
and diligent student.</p>

<p>Very soon Finley's two brothers joined him at college.
As their father was poor, the boys had to help
themselves along. Finley turned to account his talent
for drawing. He made considerable money by
painting on ivory likenesses of his classmates and professors,
receiving for a miniature $5, and for a profile
$1.</p>

<p>At the end of his college course he made painting
his chosen profession, and planned to get the best
instruction for his life work.</p>

<p>Having made a friend of the great artist, Washington
Allston, Morse went with him to London, and
there studied under Benjamin West who, as you remember,
was Robert Fulton's teacher. Morse was at
this time a young man of modest, gentle, and sunny
manner, and easily won the affection of his new
teacher.</p>

<p>West held his pupils to high standards, as the following
instance shows. Upon one occasion, after spend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>ing
much time in making what he considered to be a
finished drawing, Morse laid it before West for criticism.
Upon careful examination the master praised it
highly, and then added:</p>

<p>"Very well, sir, very well; go on and finish it."</p>

<p>"It is finished," was Morse's reply.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Mr. West, "look here, and here,
and here," pointing to defects in the drawing.</p>

<p>After spending another week upon it, Morse took
it to his teacher. Again Mr. West praised it and
added:</p>

<p>"Very well, indeed, sir; go on and finish it."</p>

<p>"Is it not finished?" Morse asked with surprise
and disappointment in his voice.</p>

<p>"Not yet," said his critic.</p>

<p>Morse spent three or four days more in trying to
perfect the work, and again handed it to his teacher,
who, after again praising it, said:</p>

<p>"Well, sir, go and finish it."</p>

<p>"I cannot finish it," said Morse, by this time thoroughly
disheartened.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mr. West, "I have tried you long
enough. Now, sir, you have learned more by this
drawing than you would have accomplished in double
the time by a dozen half-finished beginnings. It is
not numerous drawings, but the <i>character of one</i>, which
makes a thorough draughtsman. <i>Finish</i> one picture,
sir, and you are a painter."</p>

<p>After four years of study, Morse returned to Boston.
But in the meantime, like Fulton, he had grad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>ually
turned his thought from painting to invention.
His energies were now, for many years, divided between
the two.</p>

<p>During these years Morse had to depend for a
livelihood mainly upon drawing and painting. He
travelled through New Hampshire and Vermont, and
even as far as South Carolina, everywhere painting
miniatures on ivory, and establishing his reputation
as an artist.</p>

<p>In 1829 he went once more to Europe for study
and remained three years; but upon his return, although
painting occupied much of his time, his career
as an artist ended. His change of vocation turned
upon an incident of his voyage home.</p>

<p>On the ocean steamer the conversation at dinner one
day was about recent experiments with electricity. The
special question of inquiry was this: "Does the length
of wire make any difference in the velocity of the
electric current passing through it?" One of the
men present, Dr. Jackson, said that so far as experiments
yet indicated, electricity passed through any
length of wire in an instant.</p>

<p>"Then," said Morse, "thought can be transmitted
hundreds of miles instantaneously by means of electricity.
For if electricity will go ten miles without
stopping, I can make it go around the globe." What
a wonderful idea, in an instant to send thought thousands
of miles and make a record of it there! That
is what the telegraph was to do!</p>

<p>When once the possibility of this great achievement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
entered Morse's mind it took complete possession of
him, and he could think of nothing else through the
busy days and sleepless nights that followed. His
note-book was ever at hand to outline the new instrument
and to jot down the signs in sending messages.</p>

<p>In a short time he had worked out on paper the
whole scheme of transmitting thought over long distances
by means of electricity. And now began twelve
toilsome years of struggle to devise machinery for his
invention. To provide for his three motherless children,
Morse had to devote to painting much time
that he otherwise would have spent in perfecting the
mechanical appliances for his telegraph. His progress
therefore was slow and painful, but he persistently
continued in the midst of discouraging conditions.</p>

<p>His brothers, who owned a building in New York
on the corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets, allowed
Morse to have a room on the fifth floor. Here he
toiled day and night, sleeping little and eating the
simplest and scantiest food. Indeed, so meagre was
his fare, consisting mainly of crackers and tea, that
he bought his provisions at night lest his friends
might discover his need.</p>

<p>During this time of hardship he kept starvation
from his door by giving lessons in painting to a few
pupils. On a certain occasion, Morse said to one of
them, who owed him a quarter's tuition: "Well,
Strothers, my boy, how are we off for money?"</p>

<p>"Professor," said the young fellow, "I'm sorry to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
say I have been disappointed, but I expect the money
next week."</p>

<p>"Next week!" cried his needy teacher, "I shall
be dead by next week."</p>

<p>"Dead, sir?" rejoined Strothers.</p>

<p>"Yes, dead by starvation," was the emphatic answer.</p>

<p>"Would $10 be of any service?" asked the pupil,
now impressed with the seriousness of the situation.</p>

<p>"Ten dollars would save my life," was the answer
of the poor man, who had been without food for
twenty-four hours. You may be sure that Strothers
promptly handed him the money.</p>

<p>But in spite of heavy trials and many discouragements
he had by 1837 finished a machine which he
exhibited in New York. Among those present was a
gifted and inventive young man by the name of Alfred
Vail. Greatly impressed, he told Morse that he
believed the telegraph would be successful, and later
he joined Morse in a business compact.</p>

<p>Alfred Vail's father and brother were wealthy men,
the owners of large iron and brass mills, and he himself
was skilful in working brass. Morse was therefore
glad to accept him as a partner, especially on account
of his good financial backing. Young Vail was
full of hope and enthusiasm, and was of great assistance
in devising suitable apparatus for the telegraph.</p>

<p>But in spite of this substantial and timely aid, a
patent was not secured until 1840. Then followed a
tedious effort to induce the government at Washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>ton
to adopt and apply the invention. Finally, after
much delay, the House of Representatives passed a
bill "appropriating $30,000 for a trial of the telegraph."
As you may know, a bill cannot become a
law unless the Senate also passes it, but the Senate
did not seem inclined to favor this one. Many people
believed that the whole idea of the telegraph
was rank folly. They regarded Morse and the telegraph
very much as people had regarded Fulton and
the steamboat, and ridiculed him as a crazy-brained
fellow.</p>

<p>Up to the evening of the last day of the session
the bill had not been considered by the Senate.
Morse sat anxiously waiting in the Senate chamber
until nearly midnight, when, believing there was no
longer any hope, he withdrew and went home with a
heavy heart.</p>

<p>Imagine his surprise, therefore, next morning, when
a young woman, Miss Annie G. Ellsworth, congratulated
him at breakfast on the passage of his bill. At
first he could scarcely believe the good news, but when
he found that Miss Ellsworth was telling him the
truth his joy was unbounded, and he promised her
that she should choose the first message.</p>

<p>By the next year (1844) a telegraph line, extending
from Baltimore to Washington, was ready for use.
On the day appointed for trial Morse met a party of
friends in the chamber of the Supreme Court, at the
Washington end of the line, and sitting at the instrument
which he had himself placed for trial, the happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
inventor sent the message, as dictated by Miss Ellsworth,
"What hath God wrought!"</p>

<p>The telegraph was a great and brilliant achievement,
and brought to its inventor well-earned fame. Morse
married a second time and lived in a beautiful home
on the Hudson, where, with instruments on his table,
he could easily communicate with distant friends.
Simple and modest in his manner of life, he was a
true-hearted, kindly Christian man. He was fond of
flowers and of animals. The most remarkable of his
pets was a tame flying-squirrel that would sit on his
master's shoulders, eat out of his hand, and go to sleep
in his pocket.</p>

<p>In his prosperity, honors were showered upon him
by many countries. At the suggestion of the French
Emperor, representatives from many countries of Europe
met at Paris to determine upon some suitable
testimonial to Morse as a world benefactor. These
delegates voted him $80,000 as an expression of appreciation
for his great invention. Before his death,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
also, a statue to his memory was erected in Central
Park, New York.</p>

<p>In 1872 this noble inventor, at the ripe age of eighty-one,
breathed his last. The sincere expression of grief
from all over the country gave evidence of the place he
held in the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>While Morse had been patiently struggling
toward the completion of his invention, the
nation had been growing more and more tense in its
contest over slavery and State rights. As an outcome
of the bitter feeling in 1846, two years after the fulfilment
of Morse's scheme, Congress declared war against
Mexico.</p>

<p>The Southern slaveholders hoped by this war to
gain from their weak neighbor territory favorable for
the extension of slavery. For slavery had long since
been dying out in the States east of the Mississippi and
north of the Mason and Dixon Line and the Ohio.
On the south of this natural boundary line the soil
and climate were adapted to the cultivation of rice,
cotton, sugar, and tobacco. These four staples of the
South called for large plantations and an abundance
of cheap labor always subject to the bidding of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
planter. Slavery satisfied these conditions, and therefore
slavery seemed necessary to the prosperity of the
South.</p>

<p>It was because the soil and climate north of this
natural boundary line did not favor the use of slaves
that slavery gradually died out in the North. The
result was that in one section of the Union, the South,
there was a pressing demand for slavery; and in the
other, the North, there was none. As time wore on,
it became evident that the North was growing in
population, wealth, and political influence much faster
than the South. Observing this momentous fact, the
slaveholders feared that in the course of years Congress
might pass laws unfriendly to slavery. Hence,
their stubborn purpose to struggle for the extension
of slavery as far as possible into the territory west of
the Mississippi.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 448px;">

<span class="caption">Lincoln's Birthplace.</span>
</div>

<p>But in the North so powerful did the opposition to
the spread of slavery to
new States become, that
by 1855 there was a great
political party that had
such opposition as its
leading principle. One of
its ablest and most inspiring
leaders was Abraham
Lincoln. He was born in Kentucky, February 12,
1809. The rough log cabin in which he first saw the
light was the wretched home of a father too lazy and
shiftless to work, and so ignorant that he is said not to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
have learned his letters until taught by his wife. Little
Abe's only playmates were his sister Sarah, two years
older than himself, and his cousin, Dennis Hanks, who
lived in the Lincoln home.</p>

<p>When Abe was seven years old the family moved to
Indiana, and settled about fifteen miles north of the
Ohio River. The journey to their new home was very
tedious and lonely, for they had in some places to cut
a roadway through the forest.</p>

<p>Having arrived safely in November, all set vigorously
to work to provide a shelter against the winter.
Young Abe was healthy, rugged, and active, and from
early morning till late evening he worked with his
father, chopping trees and cutting poles and boughs for
their "camp." This "camp" was a mere shed, only
fourteen feet square, and open on one side. It was
built of poles lying upon one another, and had a
thatched roof of boughs and leaves. As there was no
chimney, there could be no fire within the enclosure,
and it was necessary to keep one burning all the time
just in front of the open side.</p>

<p>In this rough abode the furniture was of the scantiest
and rudest sort, very much like what we have already
observed in Boone's cabin. For chairs there were the
same kind of three-legged stools, made by smoothing
the flat side of a split log, and putting sticks into auger-holes
underneath. The tables were of the same simple
fashion, except that they stood on four legs instead of
three.</p>

<p>The crude bedsteads in the corners of the cabin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
were made by sticking poles in between the logs at right
angles to the wall, the outside corner where the logs
met being supported by a crotched stick driven into
the ground. Upon this framework, shucks and leaves
were heaped for bedding, and over all were thrown the
skins of wild animals for a covering. Pegs driven into
the wall served as a stairway to the loft, where there
was another bed of leaves. Here little Abe slept.</p>

<p>In the space in front of the open side of the cabin,
hanging over the fire, was a large iron pot, in which
the rude cooking was done. These backwoods people
knew nothing of dainty cookery, but they brought
keen appetites to their coarse fare. The principal
vegetable was the ordinary white potato, and the usual
form of bread was "corn-dodgers," made of meal and
roasted in the ashes. Wheat was so scarce that flour
bread was reserved for Sunday mornings. But generally
there was an abundance of game, such as deer,
bears, and wild turkeys, many kinds of fish from the
streams close by, and in summer wild fruits from the
woods.</p>

<p>During this first winter in the wild woods of Indiana
little Abe must have lived a lonely life. But it was a
very busy one. There was much to do in building the
cabin which was to take the place of the "camp," and
in cutting down trees and making a clearing for the
corn-planting of the coming spring. Besides, Abe
helped to supply the table with food, for he had already
learned to use the rifle, and to hunt and trap animals.
These occupations took him into the woods, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
must believe, therefore, in spite of all the hardships
of his wilderness life, that he spent many happy hours.</p>

<p>If we could see him as he started off with his gun, or
as he chopped wood for the fires, we should doubtless
find his dress somewhat peculiar. He was a tall, slim,
awkward boy, with very long legs and arms. In winter
he wore moccasins, trousers, and shirt of deerskin,
and a cap of coonskin with the tail of the animal
hanging down behind so as to serve both as ornament
and convenience in handling the cap. On a cold winter
day, such a furry costume might look very comfortable
if close-fitting, but we are told that Abe's deerskin
trousers, after getting wet, shrunk so much that they
became several inches too short for his long, lean legs.
As for stockings, he tells us he never wore them until
he was "a young man grown."</p>

<p>But although this costume seems to us singular, it
did not appear so to his neighbors and friends, for they
were used to seeing boys dressed in that manner. The
frontiersmen were obliged to devise many contrivances
to supply their lack of manufactured things. For instance,
they all used thorns for pins, bits of stone for
buttons, and home-made soap and tallow-dipped candles.
Candles, indeed, were a luxury much of the time,
and in Abe's boyhood, he was obliged in the long winter
evenings to read by the light of the wood fire
blazing in the rude fireplace of the log cabin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">

<span class="caption">Lincoln Studying.</span>
</div>

<p>Great as had been his privations in this Indiana
home, Abe had now to suffer a more grievous loss in
the death of his mother. The rough life of the forest
and the exposure of the open cabin had been too much
for her delicate constitution. Before she died she said
to her boy: "Abraham, I am going away from you,
and you will never see me again. I know that you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
will always be good and kind to your sister and father.
Try to live as I have taught you, and to love your
Heavenly Father." Many years later Lincoln said,
"All that I am, or I hope to be, I owe to my angel
mother."</p>

<p>A year after this sad event, his father brought home
a second wife, who became a devoted friend to the
motherless boy. Energetic, thrifty, and intelligent,
this woman, who had been accustomed to better things
than she found in her new home, insisted that the log
cabin should be supplied with a door, a floor, and windows,
and she at once began to make the children
"look a little more human."</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln's schooling was brief&mdash;not more
than a year in all. Such schools as he attended were
nothing like the graded schools of to-day. The buildings
were rough log cabins with the earth for floor and
oiled paper for windows. Desks were unknown, the
little school-house being furnished with rude benches
made of split logs, after the manner of the stools and
tables in the Lincoln home. The teachers were ignorant
men, who taught the children a little spelling, reading,
writing, and ciphering. While attending the last
school, Abe had to go daily a distance of four and a
half miles from his home.</p>

<p>In spite of this meagre schooling, however, the boy,
by his self-reliance, resolute purpose, and good reading
habits, acquired the very best sort of training for his
future life. He had but few books at his home, and
found it impossible in that wild country to find many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
in any other homes. Among those which he read over
and over again, while a boy, were the Bible, "&AElig;sop's
Fables," "Robinson Crusoe," "Pilgrim's Progress,"
a History of the United States, and "Weems's Life of
Washington."</p>

<p>His step-mother said of him: "He read everything
he could lay his hands on, and when he came across a
passage that struck him, he would write it down on
boards, if he had no paper, and keep it before him until
he could get paper. Then he would copy it, look at
it, commit it to memory and repeat it."</p>

<p>His step-brother said: "When Abe and I returned
to the house from work, he would go to the cupboard,
snatch a piece of corn-bread, take down a book, sit
down, cock his legs up as high as his head, and read."
When night came he would find a seat in the corner
by the fireside, or stretch out at length on the floor,
and write or work sums in arithmetic on a wooden
shovel, using a charred stick for a pencil or pen. When
he had covered the shovel, he would shave off the surface
and begin over again.</p>

<p>Having borrowed a copy of the "Life of Washington"
on one occasion, he took it to bed with him in the
loft and read until his candle gave out. Then before
going to sleep, he tucked the book into a crevice of the
logs in order that he might have it at hand as soon as
daylight would permit him to read the next morning.
But during the night a storm came up, and the rain
beat in upon the book, wetting it through and through.
With heavy heart Lincoln took it back to its owner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
who told him that it should be his if he would work
three days to pay for it. Eagerly agreeing to do this,
the boy carried his new possession home in triumph.
This book had a marked influence over his future.</p>

<p>Until he was twenty his father hired him out to all
sorts of work, at which he sometimes earned $6 a
month and sometimes thirty-one cents a day. Just
before he came of age his family, with all their possessions
packed in a cart drawn by four oxen, moved
again toward the West. For two weeks they travelled
across the country into Illinois, and finally made a new
home on the banks of the Sangamon River, a stream
flowing into the Ohio. The tiresome journey was made
in the month of March along muddy roads and over
swollen streams, young Lincoln driving the oxen.</p>

<p>On reaching the end of the journey, Abraham helped
his father to build a hut and to clear and fence ten acres
of land for planting. Shortly after this work was done
he bargained with a neighbor, Mrs. Nancy Miller, to
split 400 rails for every yard of brown jeans needed to
make him a pair of trousers. As Lincoln was tall, three
and one-half yards were needed, and he had to split
1,400 fence rails&mdash;a large amount of work for a pair
of trousers.</p>

<p>From time to time he had watched the boats carrying
freight up and down the river, and had wondered
where the vessels were going. Eager to know
by experience the life of which he had dreamed, he determined
to become a boatman. He was hungry for
knowledge, and with the same earnestness and energy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
with which he had absorbed the great thoughts of his
books, he now applied himself to learn the commerce of
the river and the life along its banks. When an opportunity
presented, he found employment on a flat boat
that carried corn, hogs, hay, and other farm produce
down to New Orleans. On one of his trips he chanced
to attend a slave auction. Looking on while one slave
after another was knocked down to the highest bidder,
his indignation grew until at length he cried out, "Boys,
let's get away from this; if I ever get a chance to hit
that thing" (meaning slavery), "I'll hit it hard."
Little did he think then what a blow he would strike
some thirty years later.</p>

<p>Tiring at length of his long journeys to New Orleans,
he became clerk in a village store at New Salem.
Many stories are told of Lincoln's honesty as displayed
in his dealings with the people in this village
store. It is said that on one occasion a woman in
making change overpaid him the trifling sum of six
cents. When Lincoln found out the mistake he walked
three miles and back that night to give the woman her
money.</p>

<p>He was now six feet four inches tall, a giant in
strength, and a skilful wrestler. Much against his
will&mdash;for he had no love of fighting&mdash;he became the
hero of a wrestling match with a youth named Armstrong,
who was the leader of the rough young fellows
of the place. Lincoln defeated Armstrong, and by his
manliness won the life-long friendship of his opponent.</p>

<p>At times throughout his life he was subject to deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
depression, which made his face unspeakably sad. But
as a rule he was cheerful and merry, and on account of
his good stories was in great demand in social gatherings
and at the cross-roads grocery stores. At such
times, when the social glass passed around, he always
declined it, never indulging in strong liquor of any
kind, nor in tobacco.</p>

<p>Lincoln was as kind as he was good-natured. His
step-mother said of him: "I can say, what scarcely
one mother in a thousand can say, he never gave me
a cross word or look, and never refused in fact or
appearance to do anything I asked him." He was
tender-hearted too, as the following incident shows:</p>

<p>Riding along the road one day with a company of
men, Lincoln was missed by his companions. One of
them, going to look for him, found that Lincoln had
stopped to replace two young birds that had been
blown out of their nest. He could not ride on in any
peace of mind until he had restored these little ones to
their home in the tree-branches.</p>

<p>In less than a year the closing of the village store in
which Lincoln was clerk left him without employment.
He therefore enlisted as a volunteer for the Black
Hawk War, which had broken out about this time, and
went as captain of his company. On returning from
this expedition, he opened a grocery store as part
owner, but in this undertaking he soon failed. Perhaps
the reason for his failure was that his interest was
centred in other things, for about this time he began to
study law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>For a while after closing his store he served the
Government as postmaster in New Salem, where the
mail was so scanty that he could carry it in his hat
and distribute it to the owners as he happened to meet
them.</p>

<p>He next tried surveying, his surveyor's chain, according
to report, being a trailing grapevine. Throughout
all these years Lincoln was apparently drifting
almost aimlessly from one occupation to another. But
whatever he was doing his interest in public affairs and
his popularity were steadily increasing. In 1834 he
sought and secured an election to the State Legislature.
It is said that he tramped a distance of a hundred miles
with a pack on his back when he went to the State
Capitol to enter upon his duties as law-maker.</p>

<p>About four years after beginning to study law, he
was admitted to the bar and established himself at
Springfield, Ill. From an early age he had been fond
of making stump speeches, and now he turned what
had been a pleasant diversion to practical advantage in
the progress of his political life. In due time he was
elected to Congress, where his interest in various public
questions, especially that of slavery, became much
quickened.</p>

<p>On this question his clear head and warm heart
united in forming strong convictions that had great
weight with the people. He continued to grow in
political favor, and in 1858 received the nomination of
the Republican party for the United States Senate.
Stephen A. Douglas was the Democratic nominee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Douglas was known as the "Little Giant," on account
of his short stature and great power as an orator.</p>

<p>The debates between the political rivals challenged
the admiration of the whole country. Lincoln argued
with great power against the spread of slavery into the
new States. Although unsuccessful in securing a seat
in the Senate, he won a recognition from his countrymen
that led to his election as President two years
later. In 1860 the Republican National Convention,
which met at Chicago, nominated "Honest Old Abe,
the Railsplitter," as its candidate for President, and
elected him in the same autumn.</p>

<p>The burning political question before the people at
this time, as for many years before, related to the extension
of slavery into the Territories. The South was
eager to have more States come into the Union as
slave States, while the North wished that slavery should
be confined to the States where it already existed.</p>

<p>Before the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in
1803, Mason and Dixon Line and the Ohio River
formed the dividing line between the free States on the
north and the slave States on the south. But after
that purchase there was a prolonged struggle to determine
whether the new territory should be slave or
free.</p>

<p>It was thought that the Missouri Compromise of
1820 would forever settle the trouble, but such was
not the case. It broke out again, as bitter as ever,
about the Mexican Cession, which became ours as a
result of the Mexican War. Again it was hoped that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the Compromise of 1850 would bring an end to the
struggle. But even after this second compromise, the
agitation over slavery continued to become more and
more bitter until Mr. Lincoln's election, when some of
the Southern States threatened to secede, that is, withdraw
from the Union. These States claimed the right
to decide for themselves whether or not they should
remain in the Union. On the other hand, the North
declared that no State could secede from the Union
without the consent of the other States.</p>

<p>Before Lincoln was inaugurated, seven of the Southern
States had seceded. The excitement was everywhere
intense. Many people felt that a man of larger
experience than Lincoln should now be at the head of
the Government. They doubted the ability of this
plain man of the people, this awkward backwoodsman,
to lead the destinies of the nation in these hours when
delicate and intricate diplomacy was needed. But, little
as they knew it, he was well fitted for the work that
lay before him.</p>

<p>While on his way to Washington for inauguration,
his friends learned of a plot to assassinate him when
he should pass through Baltimore. To save him from
violence, therefore, they prevailed upon him to change
his route and make the last part of his journey in
secret.</p>

<p>In a few weeks the Civil War had begun. We cannot
here pause for full accounts of all Lincoln's trials
and difficulties during this fearful struggle that began
in 1861 and ended in 1865. His burdens were almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
overwhelming, but, like Washington, he believed that
"right makes might" and must prevail.</p>

<p>When he became President he declared that the
Constitution gave him no power to interfere with slavery
in the States where it existed. But as the war continued,
he became certain that the slaves, by remaining
on the plantations and producing food for the Southern
soldiers, were a great aid to the Southern cause,
and thus threatened the Union. He therefore determined,
as commander-in-chief of the Union armies,
to set the slaves free in all territory whose people were
fighting against the Union. He took this step as a
military necessity.</p>

<p>The famous state paper, in which Lincoln declared
that the slaves were free in all the territory of the
seceded States whose people were waging war against
the Union, was called the Emancipation Proclamation.
This he issued on January 1, 1863, and thus made
good his word, "If ever I get a chance to strike that
thing" (meaning slavery), "I'll strike it hard."</p>

<p>On April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered his
army to General Grant at Appomattox Court House.
By this act the war came to a close. Great was the
rejoicing everywhere. But suddenly the universal
joy was changed into universal sorrow. Five days
after Lee's surrender Lincoln went with his wife and
some friends to see a play at Ford's Theatre in
Washington. In the midst of the play, a half-crazed
actor, who was familiar with the theatre, entered the
President's box, shot him in the back of the head,
jumped to the stage, and, shouting "Sic semper tyrannis!"
(So be it always to tyrants), rushed through the
wing to the street. There he mounted a horse in
waiting for him, and escaped, but was promptly hunted
down and killed in a barn where he lay in hiding. The
martyr-President lingered some hours, tenderly watched
by his family and a few friends. When on the following
morning he breathed his last, Secretary Stanton
said with truth, "Now he belongs to the ages." A
noble life had passed from the field of action; and the
people deeply mourned the loss of him who had wisely
and bravely led them through four years of heavy
trial and anxiety.</p>

<p>Wise and brave as the leadership of Abraham Lincoln
was, however, the drain of the Civil War upon
the nation's strength was well-nigh overwhelming.
Nearly 600,000 men lost their lives in this murderous
struggle, and the loss in wealth was not far short
of $8,000,000,000.</p>

<p>But the war was not without its good results also.
One of these, embodied later in the Thirteenth Amendment
to the Constitution, set free forever all the slaves
in the Union; and another swept away for all time
the evils of State rights, nullification, and secession.
Webster's idea that the Union was supreme over the
States had now become a fact which could never again
be a subject of dispute. The Union was "one and
<i>inseparable</i>."</p>

<p>The immortal words that Lincoln uttered as part of
his Second Inaugural are worthy of notice, for in their
sympathy, tenderness, and beautiful simplicity they
reveal the heart of him who spoke them. This inaugural
address was delivered in Washington on March
4, 1865, only about six weeks before Lincoln's assassination.
It closed with these words:</p>

<p>"With malice toward none, with charity for all,
with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the
right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to
bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall
have borne the battle, and for his widow and his
orphan&mdash;to do all which may achieve and cherish a
just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all
nations."</p>

<p>In tracing the leading events in the remarkable
career of the martyr-President, we have had occasion
to refer briefly to the causes and results of the
Civil War. It was a struggle that tested the manhood
quite as much as the resources of the warring
sections, and each side might well be proud of the
bravery and military skill displayed by its officers and
soldiers. Certainly each side had among its generals
some of the greatest military leaders of all time. One
of these, who is by common consent regarded as the
ablest general that led Northern troops in battle, was
Ulysses Simpson Grant.</p>

<p>He was born in a humble dwelling at Point Pleasant,
O., in April, 1822. The year following his birth
the family removed to Georgetown, O., where they
lived many years.</p>

<p>The father of Ulysses was a farmer and manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>facturer
of leather. The boy did not like the leather
business, but was fond of the various kinds of farm
work. When only seven years old he hauled all the
wood which was needed in the home and at the leather
factory, from a forest, a mile from the village. As he
was too small to load and unload the wood, the men
did that for him.</p>

<p>From the age of eleven to seventeen, according to
his own story as told in his "Personal Memoirs," he
ploughed the soil, cultivated the growing corn and
potatoes, sawed fire-wood for his father's store, and
did any other work that would naturally fall to the
lot of a farmer's boy. He had his recreations, also,
including fishing, swimming in the creek not far from
his home, skating in winter, and driving about the
country winter and summer.</p>

<p>Young Grant liked horses, and early became a skilful
rider. Lincoln told a story of him which indicates
not only his expert horsemanship, but his "bull-dog
grit" as well. One day when he was at a circus the
manager offered a silver dollar to anybody who could
ride a certain mule around the ring. Several persons,
one after another, mounted the animal only to be
thrown over its head. Young Ulysses was among
those who offered to ride, but like the others he was
unsuccessful. Then pulling off his coat, he got on
the animal again. Putting his legs firmly around the
mule's body, and seizing him by the tail, Ulysses rode
triumphantly around the ring, amid the cheers of the
expectant crowd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Although he cared little for study, his father wished
to give him all the advantages of a good education, and
secured for him an appointment at West Point. This
was indeed a rare opportunity for thorough training in
scholarship, but Ulysses was rather indifferent to it.
He had a special aptitude for mathematics, and became
an expert horseman, but with these exceptions, he took
little interest in the training received at this famous
military school, his rank being only twenty-first in a
class of thirty-nine.</p>

<p>After graduation he wished to leave the army and
become an instructor in mathematics at West Point.
But as the Mexican War broke out about that time he
entered active service. Soon he gave striking evidence
of that fearless bravery for which he was to become so
noted on the battle-fields of the Civil War.</p>

<p>It fell to his lot to deliver a message which necessitated
a dangerous ride. He says of it: "Before starting
I adjusted myself on the side of my horse farthest
from the enemy, and with only one foot holding to the
cantle of the saddle and an arm over the neck of the
horse exposed, I started at full run. It was only at
the street crossings that my horse was under fire, but
there I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I
was past and under cover of the next block of houses
before the enemy fired. I got out safely without a
scratch."</p>

<p>Shortly after the close of the war Grant was married.
Six years later he resigned from the army and
went with his family to live on a farm near St. Louis.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Although he worked hard, he found it up-hill work to
support his family, and was eventually compelled by
bad health to give up farming. He next tried the real
estate business, but without success. At last, his father
offered him a place in his leather and hardware store,
where Grant worked as clerk until the outbreak of the
Civil War.</p>

<p>With the news that the Southern troops had fired
upon the flag at Fort Sumter, Grant's patriotism was
aroused. Without delay he rejoined the army and at
once took an active part in the preparations for war.
First as colonel and then as brigadier-general, he led
his troops. At last he had found a field of action in
which he quickly developed his powers as a leader.</p>

<p>The first of his achievements was the capture of
Forts Henry and Donelson, the centre of a strong Confederate
line of defence, extending from Columbus to
Cumberland Gap. At Fort Donelson he received the
surrender of nearly 15,000 prisoners, and by his great
victory compelled the Confederates to abandon two
of their most important strongholds, Columbus and
Nashville.</p>

<p>After the loss of Fort Donelson the Confederates
fell back to a second line of defence, extending from
Memphis through Corinth to Chattanooga. The Confederate
army took position at Corinth; General
Grant's army at Pittsburg Landing, eighteen miles
away. Here, early on Sunday morning, April 6, 1862,
Grant was attacked by Johnston, and his men were
driven back a mile and a half toward the river. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
a fearful battle, lasting until nearly dark. Not until
after midnight was Grant able to rest, and then as he
sat in the rain leaning against the foot of a tree, he
slept a few hours before the renewal of battle on Monday
morning. With reinforcements he was able on the
second day to drive the enemy off the field and win a
signal victory.</p>

<p>By this battle Grant broke the second Confederate
line of defence. Although the Confederates fought
bravely and well to prevent the Northern troops from
getting control of the Mississippi River, by the close
of 1862 they had lost every stronghold except Port
Hudson and Vicksburg. In 1863, General Grant put
forth a resolute effort to capture Vicksburg, and after
a brilliant campaign laid siege to the city. For seven
weeks the Confederate army held out. Meanwhile the
people of Vicksburg found shelter in caves and cellars,
their food at times consisting of rats and mule flesh.
But on July 4, 1863, the day following General Lee's
defeat at Gettysburg, General Pemberton, with an army
numbering about 32,000 men, surrendered Vicksburg
to General Grant. Four days later Port Hudson was
captured, and thus the last stronghold of the Mississippi
came under control of the North.</p>

<p>General Grant's success was in no small measure due
to his dogged perseverance. While his army was laying
siege to Vicksburg a Confederate woman, at whose
door he stopped to ask a drink of water, inquired
whether he expected ever to capture Vicksburg. "Certainly,"
he replied. "But when?" was her next ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>tion.
Quickly came the answer: "I cannot tell exactly
when I shall take the town, but <i>I mean to stay
here till I do, if it takes me thirty years</i>."</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>General Grant having by his effective campaign won
the confidence of the people, President Lincoln in 1864
made him lieutenant-general, thus placing him in command
of all the Northern forces. In presenting the
new commission, Lincoln addressed General Grant in
these words: "As the country herein trusts you, so,
under God, it will sustain you." General Grant made
answer: "I feel the full weight of the responsibilities
now devolving upon me; and I know that if they are
met, it will be due to those armies, and above all, to
the favor of that Providence which leads both nations
and men."</p>

<p>Early in May, 1864, Grant entered upon his final
campaign in Virginia, and while he marched with his
army "On to Richmond," General Sherman, in
Georgia, pushed with his army "On to Atlanta" and
"On to the sea." Both generals were able, and both
had able opponents. Grant crossed the Rapidan and
entered the Wilderness, where Lee's army contested
every foot of his advance. In the terrible fighting that
followed Grant's losses were severe, but, with "bull-dog
grit," to use Lincoln's phrase, he pressed on, writing
to the President his stubborn resolve, "I propose to
fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."</p>

<p>It did take all summer and more, for Grant found it
impossible to capture Richmond by attacking it from
the northern side. He therefore transferred his army<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
across the James River, and attacked the city from the
south; but at the end of the summer Lee still held out.</p>

<p>Nor did Lee relinquish his position until April 2,
1865, when he was compelled to retreat toward the
west. Grant pursued him closely for a week, during
which Lee's troops suffered great privation, living
mainly on parched corn and the young shoots of trees.
Aware that the Southern cause was hopeless, the distinguished
leader of the Confederate armies, after a
most brilliant retreat, decided that the time had come
to give up the struggle.</p>

<p>While suffering from a severe sick headache, General
Grant received a note from Lee saying that the
latter was now willing to consider terms of surrender.
It was a remarkable occasion when the two eminent
generals met on that Sunday morning, in what is
known as the McLean house, standing in the little village
of Appomattox Court House. Grant writes in
his "Personal Memoirs": "I was without a sword, as
I usually was when on horseback on the field, and
wore a soldier's blouse for a coat, with the shoulder-straps
of my rank to indicate to the army who I was.... General
Lee was dressed in a full uniform
which was entirely new, and was wearing a sword of
considerable value&mdash;very likely the sword which had
been presented by the State of Virginia.... In
my rough travelling suit, the uniform of a private with
the straps of a lieutenant-general, I must have contrasted
very strangely with a man so handsomely
dressed, six feet high and of faultless form.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">The McLean House</span>
</div>

<p>The result of the interview was the surrender of
General Lee with his entire army of 26,000 men. General
Grant at this time gave striking evidence of his
great kindness of heart and fine delicacy of feeling. He
issued orders that all the Confederates who owned
horses and mules should be allowed to take them
home. "They will need them for the spring ploughing,"
he said. He spared the vanquished troops the
humiliation of marching out and stacking their arms in
token of surrender, and even stopped the firing of salutes
by his men. Never, indeed, did General Grant
appear more truly great than on the occasion of Lee's
surrender. Thus ended the military career of the
greatest general that the
North produced during
the Civil War.</p>

<p>While in the army he
seemed to have marvellous
powers of endurance.
He said of himself:
"Whether I slept
on the ground or in a
tent, whether I slept one
hour or ten in the twenty-four,
whether I had
one meal, or three or
none, made no difference. I could lie down and sleep
in the rain without caring."</p>

<img src="images/illus327.jpg" width="336" height="392" alt="General R. E. Lee." title="" />
<span class="caption">General R. E. Lee.</span>
</div>

<p>His appearance did not indicate his robust health.
He was only five feet eight inches tall, round-shoul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>dered,
and not military in bearing or walk. He had
brown hair, blue eyes, and a musical voice. He was
of a sunny disposition and singularly pure soul, never
having been known in all his life to speak an unclean
word or tell an objectionable story.
Quiet and simple in manner, he
never became excited even in the
heat of battle, but always kept himself
cool and collected, ready for
the severest ordeal that he might
have to face.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that at
the close of the war he had a warm
place in the hearts of his countrymen.
Wherever he went people flocked to see him.
But like Washington and Jefferson, he found speech-making
most difficult. At one time, in the presence of
friends, General Grant's young son Jesse, mounted a
haystack and said, "I'll show you how papa makes a
speech. 'Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very glad to
see you: I thank you very much. Good-night.'" All
present were greatly amused except Grant, who was
much embarrassed, feeling that his little son's effort
verged too closely upon the truth.</p>

<p>Grant was elected President of the United States in
1868, and served two terms. Upon retiring from the
Presidency he made a tour around the world, and was
everywhere received by rulers and people alike with
great honor and distinction.</p>

<p>During his last days he suffered much from an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>curable
disease, which became a worse enemy than he
had ever found on the field of battle. After nine
months' of struggle he died at Mount McGregor, near
Saratoga, on July 23, 1885. His body was laid to
rest in Riverside Park, on the Hudson, where in 1897
a magnificent monument was erected to his memory.
Like Lincoln and Washington, he will ever live in the
hearts of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Thus far we have directed our attention to the
prominent events in American history centring
about certain leaders and heroes. In so doing we have
in every chapter given emphasis to the achievements
of some one man. But in all these cases there were
many other men that received no mention by name,
and yet their co-operation was necessary to the success
of the leader in working out his plans.</p>

<p>This is no doubt true of all times and countries, but
it is eminently true of our own country, whose history
is full of striking instances of individual heroism and
devotion to the flag. We shall find no better example
of patriotic daring than in the late war with Spain&mdash;a
war which exhibited to us and to the world the strong
and manly qualities of American life and character. It
seems fitting, therefore, that we should in this closing
chapter briefly consider a few of the recent events that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
help us to understand what manner of people we have
come to be, and what we are able to accomplish in time
of earnest endeavor.</p>

<p>From the very beginning of her dominion in Cuba,
Spain ruled the people
there with extreme
cruelty and
oppression. Again
and again did the
Cubans, driven to
desperation by unjust
treatment, rise
in rebellion, without
success. But in
1895 they organized
an uprising
that Spain strove in
vain to put down.
In the last extremity
of her power,
she sent over as
governor-general a
man who tried to
starve the Cubans
into submission. A
large part of the population lived in the country, and
furnished the Cuban troops with food and recruits.
The Spanish commander's brutal method was to drive
these country people into the towns and cities, burning
their homes, and destroying everything that might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
be of use to feed and support the fighting Cubans.
But the Cubans were determined to win their independence
or die in the attempt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 576px;">
<img src="images/illus331.jpg" width="576" height="480" alt="The Wreck of the Maine." title="" />
<span class="caption">The Wreck of the Maine.</span>
</div>

<p>As the war continued, and this inhuman policy of
starvation grew more brutal, the horror and indignation
of the United States were aroused. Our Government
tried to induce Spain to stop her barbarous
methods, but while the attempt was still in progress an
event took place which greatly embittered the feeling
of Americans against Spain. On the night of February
15, 1898, one of our battle-ships, the Maine, was
blown up in the harbor of Havana, and 266 of our
sailors were killed. Many believed that this awful deed
was the work of Spanish officials; and this conviction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
deepened when a careful investigation was made by a
court of naval inquiry. In all parts of this country the
excitement of the people increased until they were ready
to go to war with Spain if she would not change her
policy toward Cuba.</p>

<p>But Spain was so stubborn that President McKinley,
after trying in every possible way to prevent hostilities,
was obliged to say in a message that "the war in Cuba
must stop"; and on April 25, 1898, Congress took the
momentous step of declaring war.</p>

<p>Our Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Long, lost no time
in sending a despatch to Commodore Dewey,&mdash;who
was in command of an American fleet of six war-vessels
at Hong-Kong,&mdash;directing him to proceed at once to
the Philippine Islands and capture or destroy the Spanish
fleet stationed there.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/illus333.jpg" width="359" height="336" alt="Admiral Dewey." title="" />
<span class="caption">Admiral Dewey.</span>
</div>

<p>Two days later Commodore Dewey's fleet was
steaming southward toward Manila Bay, in search of
the Spanish squadron of ten war-vessels and two torpedo-boats.
It was extremely important that these
ships of war should be captured or destroyed before
they could make their way to our Pacific coast and
attack American cities.</p>

<p>On the night preceding May 1st our fleet entered
Manila Bay. The supreme moment in the life of Commodore
Dewey, now in his sixty-second year, had come.
He was 7,000 miles from home and in hostile waters.
Without even a pilot to guide his fleet as it moved
slowly but boldly into the bay, he knew well that he
might be going into a death-trap. Two torpedoes ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>ploded
just in front of the flag-ship Olympia, which
was in the lead, but the fearless commander did not
swerve from his course.</p>

<p>Drawn up at the entrance of Bakor Bay, not far
from Manila, was the Spanish fleet,
protected on either side by strong
shore batteries. When about three
miles distant Commodore Dewey
quietly said to the captain of the
Olympia, "If you are ready, Gridley,
you may fire." Spanish shells
had already filled the air all about
the American fleet, but as the Spanish gunnery was exceedingly
poor it did little serious damage. During the
battle the American fleet steamed forward in single
file, the Olympia in the lead. After going for some
distance toward Manila the ships swung round and returned,
firing terrible broadsides into the Spanish fleet as
they passed. Five times they followed the course in this
way, each time drawing nearer to the enemy's position,
and each time pouring in a more furious and deadly fire.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus334.jpg" width="336" height="374" alt="President McKinley" title="" />
<span class="caption">President McKinley</span>
</div>

<p>At seven o'clock the Spanish flagship dashed boldly
out, as if with the purpose of running down the
Olympia. But the American war-vessels concentrated
their fire upon her so that she had to turn back. As
she was swinging around, the Olympia hurled a shell
which raked her deck, killing or wounding her captain
and sixty of her sailors. About this time two Spanish
torpedo-boats darted out toward the American fleet,
and one of them, with the evident purpose of blowing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
her up, headed for the Olympia. But a well-aimed
shell exploded upon the deck of the torpedo-boat, and
sank it to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>At the end of two hours, it being plain that the Spanish
fleet was nearly done for, Commodore
Dewey decided to give his
tired men a rest. He therefore withdrew
his fleet from the scene of battle,
and gave his brave sailors some
breakfast. Three hours later he renewed
the fight, which ended with the
destruction of the entire Spanish fleet.
Although 1,200 Spaniards were killed or wounded, not
one American was killed and only eight were wounded.
None of Dewey's war-vessels received serious injury.
The battle was a brilliant exhibition of superb training
and seamanship on the part of the American sailors,
whose rapid and accurate handling of the guns was
marvellous.</p>

<p>The people were electrified with joy when the news
of the glorious achievement in Manila Bay was cabled
to America. On May 9th, Congress voted that ten
thousand dollars ($10,000) should be spent in securing
a sword for Commodore Dewey and medals for all
his men, and President McKinley promptly appointed
him a rear-admiral. Before the middle of August an
army of 15,000 troops, under General Merritt, was
sent to Manila to unite with the fleet under Admiral
Dewey in capturing the city. Manila surrendered on
August 13th.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>With the destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila,
within a week after Congress declared war, all danger
of attack from Spanish war-vessels upon our Pacific
coast was at an end. But there was grave fear that
the Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera might attack
the large and wealthy cities upon our Atlantic coast.
Shortly after the war began, this fleet was reported to
have left the Cape Verde Islands and to have directed
its course toward Cuban waters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 800px;">

<span class="caption">"Escolta," Manila's Main Street.</span>
</div>

<p>At once Americans began to put serious questions
which nobody could answer. "Where is Cervera
going?" they asked. "Will he try to break the blockade
which an American fleet under Admiral Sampson
is keeping up on the northern coast of Cuba? Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
he try to intercept and destroy the battle-ship Oregon?<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Or, will he bring havoc and destruction upon us by
sailing straight for some great Atlantic seaport?"
Americans looked anxious and worried as they considered
these questions.</p>

<p>But the uncertainty did not long continue, for soon
it was learned by cable that Cervera had stopped at
Martinique, and later at a small island off the coast of
Venezuela, whence he had speedily steamed northward
toward Cuba. We now know that he went to Santiago
harbor, which he thought would prove a good hiding-place
while his fleet took on board coal and other supplies.
Shortly after Cervera's arrival at Santiago an
American fleet under Commodore Schley discovered
him, and blockaded the harbor in order to prevent his
escape. It was extremely important to keep him "bottled
up" there until an American army might come
down and capture Santiago and the Spanish army which
held the place. This capture accomplished, Cervera
would have to fight either in the harbor or out on the
open sea. But there was still some anxiety lest he
might on some dark, stormy night manage to steal out
and make his escape.</p>

<p>One reason why Cervera went into the Santiago harbor
was that the entrance was very narrow and well
protected by headlands surmounted by batteries. At
its narrowest place, the channel was not much more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>than a hundred yards wide. If, therefore, the American
war-vessels should attempt to enter the harbor they
would have to enter in single file, and the foremost one
would possibly be blown up by the Spanish torpedoes,
many of which were planted in the channel. The sinking
of a single vessel in the channel would block the
way for all the rest.</p>

<p>With these facts in mind Admiral Sampson planned
to obstruct the entrance to Santiago harbor to prevent
the Spanish fleet from getting out. Lieutenant Hobson,
a young man of twenty-eight, worked out the plan
of sinking the collier Merrimac across the channel;
and to him the important task of carrying it out was
assigned. Torpedoes were so arranged on the sides of
the Merrimac that their explosion would shatter her
bottom and sink her in the channel.</p>

<p>There was serious difficulty in selecting the small
number of brave, cool-headed men who were to accompany
Lieutenant Hobson in this perilous enterprise,
for several hundred American sailors were eager to go,
even though they knew that in so doing they were
running serious risk of capture or death. But such was
the heroic temper of the American sailors that many
of them begged for an opportunity of rendering this
loyal service.</p>

<p>On the night appointed for the daring feat, the Merrimac
did not get well started before the morning light
began to appear in the eastern sky, so that Admiral
Sampson recalled the expedition.</p>

<p>After a long, nervous day of waiting, the next morn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>ing,
June 3d, the Merrimac started off a second time.
The vessel moved stealthily forward with its eager,
silent crew, but before the place of sinking could be
reached the Spaniards discovered her. Suddenly from
the forts and the war-vessels in the harbor a storm of
shot and shell beat in pitiless fury about the Merrimac.
But she pressed forward. When the moment came
for her to be swung across the channel Hobson found
that the rudder of the ship had been shot away, so
that she could not be swung about according to the
plan. He therefore had to be content with sinking her
<i>along</i> instead of <i>across</i> the channel.</p>

<p>When the torpedoes exploded and she went down,
her crew of eight men, struggling for life in the seething
waters, managed to reach a float which they had
brought with them on the deck of the collier. To this
float they clung, hanging on with their hands, for they
dared not expose their bodies as targets to Spanish
soldiers on land or to Spanish sailors in the launches
that were trying to find out what had happened. For
some hours Hobson and his men remained in this uncomfortable
position, shivering with the cold. At
length Hobson hailed an approaching launch to which
he swam. He was pulled in by an elderly man, with
the exclamation, "You are brave fellows." This was
Admiral Cervera, who treated the prisoners, Lieutenant
Hobson and his crew, with great kindness. With
the rest of the world he admired the courageous spirit
of the "brave fellows" who had given so much in the
service of their country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>During the remainder of June, the American fleet
kept watch at the harbor entrance. Before the end of
the month an American army of 15,000 men was ready
to advance through a tropical forest upon the Spanish
defences outside of Santiago. On July 1st the Americans
made a vigorous attack upon these outworks,
and won a glorious victory.</p>

<p>It looked to Cervera as if he might be compelled to
surrender his fleet without striking a blow. Although
he was likely to suffer defeat in a battle, there was nothing
to gain by remaining in the harbor. So he decided
to dash boldly out, in a desperate effort to escape.
When at about half-past nine of that quiet Sunday
morning (July 3d) the foremost Spanish war-vessel was
seen heading at full speed out of the harbor, the American
sailors sent up a shout, "The Spanish fleet is coming
out!" and leaped forward to their places at the guns.
As at Manila, the battle was one-sided. The superior
seamanship and gunnery of the Americans enabled
them quickly to win a victory as brilliant as that won
by Dewey and his men. Every Spanish vessel was destroyed,
600 Spaniards were killed, and 1,300 captured.
Not one American ship was seriously injured, while but
one American was killed and one badly wounded.
About the middle of July Santiago and a Spanish army
of 22,000 men surrendered to the Americans.</p>

<p>Although this ended the serious fighting of the war,
the treaty of peace was not ratified by the United States
Senate until February 6, 1899. In accordance with
this treaty Spain gave up Cuba and ceded Porto Rico<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
to the United States; and she also ceded to us the Philippine
Islands, in return for which we agreed to pay
her $20,000,000.</p>

<p>But some of the most striking results of the war with
Spain received no
mention in the
terms of the treaty.
From the beginning
of the struggle,
Spain doubtless
hoped that one
or more of the
Great Powers of
Europe might intervene
in her behalf.
Some of
them, with ill-concealed
dislike for
the United States,
were quite ready
to interfere in
Spain's interests.
But England refused
to take any part in the movement. Her friendly
attitude toward us in this struggle has done much to
bring the two countries into closer sympathy with each
other. A reflection of this good-will toward England
was especially evident at the time of Queen Victoria's
death in January, 1901.</p>

</div>

<p>But, after all, one of the most striking results of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
war with Spain has been the bringing of the various
sections of our own country into closer sympathy and
union. It is safe to say that never before have the
North, the South, the East, and the West felt so closely
bound together in thought and feeling. Let us hope
that with noble ideals of the high destiny that awaits
us, we shall go forward to greater achievements than
we have yet known in our history.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
